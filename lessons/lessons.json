        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Good afternoon, this is Monjoronson. It is good to be here with you, once again. For newcomers, a word of introduction or two: This planet is one of millions in the greater universe that is inhabited. Each planet has an evolutionary path upon which it develops. These are platforms for spiritual growth of mortals—this is an environment for challenge, for decision making, for self-directed will.\nThis planet and several others suffered many reversals in its pattern and program of growth that is not normal for most planets. The managers and directors who were responsible for the over-care of these planets abdicated to their own egos, and led these worlds into darkness. For the protection of the rest of the universe, these planets were placed in quarantine. The spiritualized energy circuits that support the growth and development of these planets were broken, and broken suddenly. Only within the last few decades, have these circuits been reconnected, as the adjudication has taken place for the tyrants who overthrew the moral growth of these planets.\nYour planet has been recently reconnected and I am one element of many that has come here to help bring your planet back on course for its spiritual growth. The disarray, the immorality, the unethical behavior, the egoistic control and demands of individuals on your planet have been very destructive. It has retarded the development of your planet and put many billions of souls in jeopardy. Therefore, the Creator of this local universe, Christ Michael, has devised a Correcting Time to set this world and the other [37] worlds back on course. The great benefit of this program to the souls of these worlds is that they will have tremendous strength of character as they go on in the infinite journey of their spiritual growth, and eventually arrive in Paradise to become part of the Finaliter Corps, the final destination of mortals who have eventually been embraced by the Creator in Paradise.\nI am a descending Son from Paradise; I am one of several Sons who descend from Paradise to the worlds of time and space. There have been many who have been scheduled to come to the planets in quarantine, but these did not take place, as it was not appropriate at that time. Your world has been in darkness and has lacked the leadership that it needed to help its nations, civilizations, and cultures to develop more perfect moral characters of ethical values that would come from families that are generators of moral individuals who have a spiritual center.\nYou, who are here today, have regained your center, much of it through your own curiosity, much of it through the inner guidance of your inner spirit that has helped you reach out and touch sources that can assist you. In no case, during your career on this planet, or the forth-coming lives that you will have as you progress, will anyone ever abrogate your self-will or your decisions—they are always sovereign. Therefore, we of this Administration of Christ Michael of this local universe engage you to co-creatively develop your lives in accord with its destiny, its life-plan. And so, my presence here is a benefit of Christ Michael to your world.\nMy presence on this planet has only been known for the last several years. It has however, been anticipated for centuries, as many religions do anticipate a personality of divine character, who would come here and assist your world to be saved. My presence here is not to heal your world by a fait accompli, but by a co-creative participation with you, where you make decisions to assist yourself and your world, to uplift itself, to sustain itself into the future.\nWars and destruction of the magnitude that have occurred on your planet are virtually unknown in the universe. We embrace you with great love and mercy, and that is why there is a tremendous effort to bring truly divine justice into your world, and particularly for you—each of you individually—as you progress from this world, from this lifetime, to your next. Every opportunity will be given to you over and above those of other planets that are on course, to assist you to make those decisions to participate in your universe course, or not.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson: \"When you are born into this world you find yourself naked and alone, and divorced from all you know and comprehend. The journey of your life is to piece together that from which you came, that which you are, and that which you will become.”\n\"There are veils around you in all ways, forging a barrier between you and your true Divine Self, between you and your colleagues, and between you and your own sense of the reality that sits beneath that which you perceive; yet with care, effort and love within your heart, you start to chip away at those veils to discover yourself and the wondrous entities that share their worlds with you, forging the veil into a new structure, no longer a barrier but a device to allow you the wonder of experience life fully on earth.”\n\"Do not be distressed by your apparent separation from that which you feel as home, but instead delight in the glory of all that is on Earth, which you are unable to experience in any other place within this universe. If you saw already what the true nature of reality was then you would be stripped of the wondrous motion towards perfection and of the childlike delight formed when discovering that which is new to your perceptions.”\n\"Think of this life as a game, a game in which there are no losers and many, many different paths to the final stage. It’s a game of exploration, of fun, of joy and of sorrow, and like all good games it would not be exciting without fear, apprehension and anxiety at times.”\n\"These moments help to stand you in good stead for a future as Divine Being, to empathize and understand those still encompassed within the lowest planes of the ascendant mortals.”\n\"Know every move has been calculated and its potential assessed, though it remains your own will, which dictates which potential is followed. We delight in progressing our paths alongside you, watching the way you tackle emergency and trauma, and comforting you when it all becomes too much.”\n\"Know that your efforts, always valiant are noted and recorded and when the time comes to look back on your lessons you will often see that those which form the greatest part of your ‘learnings’ are the ones that passed unnoticed within your own times.”\n\"In all that you are and all that you can be, you are perfected beings finding the way of will in a world of dichotomy and inconsistency. Each turn you take is a marvel and part of God’s plan to experience how life becomes itself when separated from all that it already knows.”\n\"Feed from the light of the sun, find sustenance in your communion with others, and look to the heavens for inspiration and fortitude. We are by you side and we will never leave you until your journey on this plane is through.”\n\"By the morning, all will be clear.\"\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Good afternoon, this is Monjoronson. .. Many have read these transcripts and some have commented upon their relevancy to your issues and problems on national and global scales, and even in your personal lives. These lessons are provided to you—meaning \"you\" in this generation and tens of dozens of generations to come—as a means of interpreting what is happening and what is going on, what has happened in your world around you. As your psychologists, psychiatrists, historians, philosophers, and we have told you, it is not so much what happens to you that affects your life, but how you interpret what happens to you that affects you. Gain the most from these experiences by taking time to reflect by yourself or with others about them, and strive to interpret them from larger perspectives.\nMany, many people in the world question the relevancy of the Bible, in its greatest extent or in its diminutive extent, whether it includes some of the books or all of the books that are available, and even those that have not been discovered yet. How relevant is it to your lives? Yet, in times of desperation, times of desolation, times of failure and collapse, people go to that source as a means of seeking solace, and a means of interpreting what has happened to them, so that they might have insights, guidance, and wisdom from their experiences. These transcripts offer another means for interpreting the experiences and historic developments of your contemporary times.\nThese lessons provide future generations, and this one now, with a means of interpreting what is going on around them, a means of finding solace, peace, wisdom, guidance, insight, into your world and into your own personal life. We provide these lessons to you—to you individually—and to your world. We provide them with the means to go out to tens-of-millions of people via the Internet in the span of a day, where people can read them in the silence of their homes or their offices, for guidance and for wisdom, for insights into their lives.\n.. As the Internet matures and the software of the search engines matures, you will be able to search and correlate many things together, and you will have many more great insights into what these archives contain.\n",

        "title": "The Love of the Universe",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Let me speak briefly now about the love of the universe. The love of the universe is the love of harmony, the love and harmony of union, of oneness, of integration. You cannot move your feet forward without the action of love in your life. Your body coordinates its energy so that you move forward. This is love in action on a very plain, material level. So, too, do societies move through time with love, when they coordinate the efforts of social activity for the development and evolvement of good and wholeness in the lives of individuals. Societies do not exist for themselves—political entities are simply a means of governing large masses of people, for the benefit of individuals, for the benefit of humankind, for the civilization that is advancing. These are all sustainable. The laws of sustainability are well known in the universe on millions of planets—except yours.\nYou are beginning to come into the awareness of sustainable social laws, political laws—not the laws written in books, but the laws of behavior, the laws of decision—this is the law of harmony, this is the law of love. Your God, your Creator, the First Source and Center loves you! What does this mean? It means simply that you live; you were begotten in a universe that is benevolent, beneficent, good and wholesome—outside for the decisions of selfish and evil individuals who harm you. The decisions you make are ones that will be good for you, but you can make ones that can harm you as well. You live in a universe of love. This means that good begets good, and that oneness begets wholeness. You can be a part of this, and when your thoughts, your beliefs, your actions, your decisions meld with others, then you are an agent of love, you are an agent of love and light.\n",

You and all of you out here are students in a vast school designed exactly for you and just like any school that gets built you would never consider wondering whether the students were worthy of attending the school. This entire university was designed for you and without you it has no purpose. All of you out there are the participants in this process which makes this process real.\nTherefore banish from all of your thought patterns any semblance of needing to measure up, to prove your worthiness, to somehow qualify to be who you are. You are exactly why we are here. You are worthy beyond description. You are cherished by a universe. You are the little children for whom the school was built. There is no purpose other than that, so enjoy, relish, seize the moment. A universe is at attention awaiting your choice and as you each decide to allow the universe latitude, we will use every avenue of approach to facilitate our curriculum and without students there is no need for teachers.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I greet you now, I am Monjoronson, most pleased once again to have such devoted individuals come back to the well. …It is my mission to make it known to every mortal of the realm that they as well are encircuited. They as well have as part of their being an aspect of divinity. This Magisterial Mission will be an age of awakening, of increased awareness, of discovering that which already is. It is such a great pleasure to have as a mission statement this task of raising awareness and bringing the family of man into the awareness that they are also children of God and that they have a cosmic family as well.\nThere is such distance to cover and those of you so far away do not feel as though you can approach the center of divinity. You feel disenfranchised from your larger family. You have been alone so very long that you have lost sight of your relationship to your oldest ancestors, your Creators. But our task is to spread the good news that you are not disenfranchised, you are encircuited. You are not unknown, you are cherished and loved. You are not forgotten. We are here for you and with you. We seek to extend your awareness to embrace your true identity that you are an individual known and cherished by not only your local Creator Son but by the First Source and Center of all that is who has assigned you a reflection of Himself.\nThis reflection is a homing device that will guide you back through your many manifestations and return you to that presence that a part of you knows and feels and is familiar with. When you partner with this aspect of yourself you too can gain this familiarity, this certainty of awareness. It is our task to tell all the children that they are the children of divine parents and as such they will grow up to resemble their parents, that this is your destiny. This is your journey before you. Throughout this process this process you have had great assistance and now in this age we are bringing forward new arenas of assistance to bring you back into this awareness of relationship. And so we will joyfully proceed with our assignments of uplifting the family of man one at a time. And we are overjoyed to have such willing assistance such as yourselves to aid us in this process.\n",

        "title": "I am as real as you are. Come Get to Know Me",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  “I am as real as you are and together we may decide to choose to get to know each other and develop a relationship. I extend my welcome to all who will meet me in this way and who will take me up on my offer to develop a real relationship. I assure you I take my commitments quite seriously as I will demonstrate to you in time. This and only this is the way you will get to know me. You will register my energy signature and you will perceive the tones of my personality in recorded messages and written transcripts but these will only give you a glimpse about me. If you truly want to know me it is as simple as making your requests known and providing a space \"within you\" for us to meet.”\n“You see there is no \"within me\"- you are the spirit bound up in the material vehicle. You can decide to create space for me there as well and we may meet. The question extends to say, will you know me by signs or by faith? And I would ask, what greater sign would you like than you receive in this hour? I would point out to you that this sign occurs not to bring you faith but because you have brought faith to this process. And so yes, it is by faith, it is with faith and the signs are all around you. From my perspective, the signs are quite plentiful but I respect that they may not be as obvious to you.”\n“You must adhere to your dimension but you as developing mortals of the realm are embryos unto the next dimension. You are not confined forever to a strictly mortal status. You have other components as well. You have divine grace and influence as well and these are your guides through the transformation of your limited material experience into the freedom of spiritual expression.”\n“Be assured that all things are becoming new in this time and you may see for yourselves the truth of this statement as you witness things unheard of on your world transpire”\n“The answers I provide, many times are unverifiable; that is unverifiable by any known source that you have access to. They must either be taken on faith or rejected for lack of it.”\n“It is not oftentimes possible to cross reference answers although many times you will detect the overlapping of responses from teacher to teacher but the object of this exercise is not to stimulate your intellect but rather to stimulate your spirit; to foster your ability to expand your own spiritual dimension as well as to experience the spiritual dimension of others. This has very little to do with any material components, rather this is a spiritual pursuit taken in faith and rewarded in faith. If you restrict yourself to the intellectual pursuit of the understanding of spirit, you never cross the line to the actual experience of spirit.”\n“The point of my attempting these communications with you is to bring you the feeling of spirit, the sense of awareness, the appreciation for my energy signature and to that end I will spare no effort, but this mission cannot be accomplished with intellectual stimulation because it is similar to telling someone what the day is like outside versus their own personal experience of stepping outside and seeing, feeling, hearing it for themselves. The one is simply no substitute for the other. It can be rewarding to some degree to be told about something but the true reward for your efforts is to experience it personally.”\n",

        "title": "The Name of Monjoronson",
        "Body": "Monjoronson: You call me Monjoronson, but my name is not Monjoronson. Many groups around the world call me by different names. I am the anticipated Anointed One, the Holy One sent by God. For you, this means Christ Michael, my Brother, who is the Creator of this Local Universe, and I am on a mission from Paradise as well, to uphold this work here and assist the mortals on this planet to rejoin the universe in peace and light and love.\nLet me clarify for you. Christ Michael is of the Michael Order of Creator Sons, and he is from Paradise, as I am from Paradise. Our Holy Father is the First Source and Center, the Creator of the [Grand] Universe, and we have engaged this [Local] Universe for its growth and development. I have been sent and volunteered to work with Christ Michael, who is my Brother. He is a God in your estimation. We are both Anointed. I am not the First Source and Center of the Universe that brought all that exists into existence. He is not the First Source and Center, but he is a Creator Son, who has manipulated the energies of this local area, so that it has now been transformed and created into a Local Universe of millions and millions of stars and planets. We are Brothers; we are both Anointed, as we come from the Creator. All who come from the Creator, who are sent forward to the material worlds, are anointed. We are on a mission; it is our work that we are doing here, that is anointed. We have the blessing of the First Source and Center, to be here and to engage this world, and to bring it into an era of light and life, through our efforts, co-creatively with you.\nStudent: ... Why, since you are communicating with us, and have been communicating with us on a weekly basis for quite a long time, instead of the mystery or the intrigue, why is it that at this point, we cannot clearly know who you are.\nMonjoronson: It is a matter of convenience for you here. My name \"Monjoronson,\" in other languages, does not equate to \"Monjoronson.\" There are cultural names for the Anointed One. I am not a \"savior,\" though I am here to assist in the healing of your planet. It is not necessary for me to reveal my name now, as it will be known in the future. There are many billions of people on your planet who do not know me, who have no acquaintance-ship with me. We do not wish to make wrong, those people who know me by other names. It is not necessary to put them in the wrong, or to be incorrect, whether it is you or groups in other nations and cultural or language groups.\nWe accept the words, the title, the name that you give me now, as long as it is nominally correct and appropriate for my position, my function and my presence/power. We are not into a religionist activity at this time; we are simply encouraging people to believe that there is a higher power involved in the maintenance and management of their planet. This involves Christ Michael’s tremendous hierarchy of authority and command and management on this planet, which includes that of my activities from Paradise. Once I have revealed myself to all people, then I will reveal my name to all people, and everyone will know me by that name. The \"they\" that was spoken of means other people around your world, who would speak about me would use my name as well.\n",

I come with an entourage, a corps of support staff, associations with the Planetary Manager and midwayer creatures, who have existed from the beginnings of your world, and associations with the angelic realm…\nStudent: Can you describe the relationship with your entourage?\nMonjoronson: Think in terms of a very large corporation, a global corporation that has entered into new territory. You begin by making contact with the locals, with those who are willing to experience new parameters of their existence and their experience in the world. My staff are many. They are much like an advance corps; they have been here long before I have. They are much like a silent crew of a rock star, that goes forward to make arrangements, physical and in the marketing. Where are individuals who are receptive? What organizations can we tap? Who can we enlist? Who can we ask to support us? Who is open to speak with us? Who is willing to come forward and advise with us?\nMy staff is working on educational materials. My staff works on the lessons that we present. My staff works with the Most High liaisons, the Melchizedeks who are associated and affiliated with almost all associations and organizations on your planet. We have benignly infiltrated all over your world, yet make no decisions that abrogate any of your decisions. We do not \"tinker\" with your mind. We do not make you write things you do not want to write; we do not make you say things you do not want to say. Our efforts are totally cooperative.\nFor instance, you would be very interested in knowing and understanding how a section of my staff works peacefully with the minds of individuals in religions that are friendly to a Creator. At no time, ever, do we make decisions that abrogate your will. However, to those minds that are open, to those minds that open themselves to higher wisdom and guidance, this is entrée for us to provide what you call \"insights,\" developments of thinking, new theorems in your theologies, new thoughts about your relationship to the world, and to the universe. All sustainable religions evolve. All evolving religions can become sustainable with spiritual guidance.\nAll sustainable religions are receptive to revelation; even businessmen receive revelation; even inventors receive revelation; writers do, artists do, and so do theologians and thoughtful, contemplative individuals in religions—even those who are far away from the national or global organizations. Some of the greatest, most grand thoughts and decisions and writings have evolved from individuals out in the plains of the world. Our people—my staff—are involved with all those who are open to receive, at all levels of social and civilizational organization. This may seem nebulous, tentative, even vacuous to you, but there is a real, palpable contact being made with all open individuals in your world, particularly individuals in organizations.\n",

        "title": "Keep the Stove Hot, We Are Coming",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Today I wish to speak to you about my work with you. My presence and my mission is for you individually; my presence and mission is to help uplift and upgrade your planet, so that future generations more easily come into alignment with the way of the universe, of love—universal harmony—more easily, more naturally and earlier in the course of their life, so that eventually parents who have children, bring their children into the world ready with the values and beliefs that are in alignment with a loving life, on your planet.\nAs you have been told, since the very inception of the Teaching Mission and Correcting Time, this will be a co-creative effort to heal your planet—\"our planet.\" Each of you has, that I have seen in you, little understanding of this in your thinking. This will not be a relationship of organizational authority, but one of joint, cooperative authority. We are in the phases now of preparing our staff to work on a regular basis, intimately and personally with you, as you participate, in the capacity that you are able to with this organization. Some of you will work directly with us in your world. Some of you will be well aware of us and cooperative, and align your energies in work, thoughts, and emotions with those of this mission.\nWe have heard a phrase that describes some mortals who are resistant to change, as being \"hardheaded.\" Well, it is oftentimes not that a person is resistant, but simply not capable, not trained, not sensitive to the nuances of a cooperative relationship. Now, extend that or overlay that onto my staff. It is going to require, and we are now in the process of training our staff, particularly those who will be working with you personally, on a one-to-one basis, how to actually do that. It is not that my staff is hardheaded, but this is a remarkable journey of cooperative, co-creative effort.\nYou have heard many higher-minded / high-minded phrases about co-creative union and cooperative efforts of us working together. The realities are that we know that as willing as you are, it will be much like herding cats—that we love you, we care for you, we wish the best for you, we are compassionate to your needs, and we are sensitive to your autonomy. Yet, we must bring you along, coax you to join with us arm in arm as we walk together in \"step\"—not out of step, but in step together. This will require remarkable adjustments, for my staff and for you.\nMy staff thoroughly understands the eccentricities of mortals on Urantia, and your penchant for autonomy and resistance to good. And you are used to going your own way. Some of you simply give up and say, \"Show me.\" This is insufficient, too, my friends. You must join us energetically, actively—not passively—but assertively, willing to reach out, extend yourself and learn how to cooperate, how to be led without feeling like you are leaderless, that you have no participation in where you are going. It is essential that you thoroughly invest in this co-creative, cooperative effort to complement the Magisterial Mission and the healing of your planet, in the begetting of whole individuals early in their lives.\nYou have many business examples of diverse groups coming together in a cooperative effort to accomplish a common good, or a common outcome to produce a common service, a functional product and it requires many people working on this, from diverse cultures, different languages, different systems of measurement to come out with a product or service that works. Now multiply the difficulty of that by manyfold—many of you have not yet felt the presence of those who are not material.\nYou will be startled, some of you will be in awe, [and] some of you will be in denial that this is actually occurring. As I approach materiality, more and more of this Magisterial Mission becomes \"locked in\" to the temporal pace of your planet. We are not ready to lock in place this mission yet, for there is so much work to do. I will lose my flexibility when that occurs. In many ways I will be a captive of this planet, though I will have the same capacity to lay down my body and travel elsewhere, as I am needed, or as is required, there upon returning to my body, taking it up, and traversing as a captive on the planet again.\nSo many of you are waiting. So many of you are prepared. So many of you will be gone before I appear. Those of you who are prepared and waiting, you are much like those so many years ago, who waited for the \"return,\" who waited for the healing of your planet, healing and completion, patiently waiting for years, decades—perhaps centuries. I do not and will not reveal to you when the mission will become corporeal in full, and operational at a level that you can participate in. It would be foolhardy to do so. You are agondonters. I envision that one day, a decade or two after the mission is in its corporeal form, that someone will write a novel or a true story of the last agondonters as a chronicle to those who waited. Those of you who believe, have faith, trust and know that I will be here in material form, that Christ Michael will then follow me in the time after that in the distant future.\nYour faith is a trusting faith. Your faith is a faith with a smile on your face, knowing that it is happening—not \"will happen\"—but \"is\" happening. You have a gleeful appreciation that it is in process that it is now in the form of becoming manifest. You are wonderful caretakers of this mission; you are wonderful supporters of what must be done and what will occur. I know that many of you are anxiously waiting, as though you had invited company over to your home for dinner, and you had an appointed time of seven o’clock for them to appear, and here it is eight-thirty and they still have not arrived, though they call occasionally saying, \"Oh, we are just a bit down the road.\"\nWe know that these assurances we provide to you feel much the same way—\"Well, when are you going to arrive?\" \"When is dinner?\" But we say to you, \"Keep the stove hot, please, we are coming.\" You will hear this message over and over again; it will be repeated many, many times in the future to help you become aware that you are not alone. In the meantime, this provides a wonderful opportunity for training, for personal upliftment, for practice in meditation, in silence and stillness to be with your Thought Adjuster in preparation for this wonderful mission in which I am participating.\n",

        "title": "A Nested Lesson on the Classroom and the TR/ Communication Process",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Each one of you is a generator of light and you shine out and are seen by all the heavens when you come together to form this collective petition of seeking the attraction overwhelming for one such as myself who has volunteered to be in service to such as yourselves.\nTherefore has the miracle of forming this union of this hour been accomplished through your desires, through my desire, through the will of The Father we have come together. I embrace you each one and welcome you to this arena, this classroom. I appreciate your questions and desires to know more about this process to come to greater understanding about your relationship to this process and how you may be engaged more certainly in this process. And because you seek, you shall find. Because you petition for understanding it shall be granted. Because you pursue this seeking you shall find even in this hour.\nCertainly when the classroom is arranged, and the eager students file in then the focus of the entire project at hand becomes to give the students what they are asking for, provide for them that they may understand. And so it is in your coming to this classroom, you assemble with your intentions, you arrive at this place by your own free will and in so doing you provide us with your clear signal of intentions that you are ready to receive and I tell you plainly, you are ready to receive. Those who come in contact with these words in any form are ready to receive. Do not consider yourselves standing outside of this classroom wanting to come in, do not see yourselves as unworthy of attending such a class. Allow that this classroom is designed for you. You are the ones that we wait for to show up to class and so we shall begin in earnest our training.\nI must make it clear that the goal of this program is not to educate a classroom of transmitter/receivers as you are familiar with that term. True enough this may be your individual desires and as such they will be fostered and promoted and you can rest assured that those of you whose desire this above all shall be successful in your attempts but not everyone is needed to provide this service of liaison between those of us unseen and those of you who are seen. Rather the goal of this curriculum, particularly this curriculum in this hour will be to provide you with the exercises and concepts necessary for you to bridge the gap between what it is to be in partnership with your divine fragment.\nYou see, there are only a number of transmitter receivers and there are only a number of individual personalities on the other side of the veil and at this time these relationships are cherished by you because they are your avenue to pass between one side of the veil and the other or at least hear from the other side of the veil. But within each one of you glorious students there is a red line straight to The Father. You have direct access and need not another personality to intervene for you to establish this direct connection. We will be focusing on the identification, the terminology, the approaches, the method, the means whereby you may increase your capacity for understanding and your level of awareness.\nThrough this process you will begin to be infused with the awareness of this circuitry. I encourage you to follow the advice offered earlier of practicing with techniques that are comfortable to you. Practicing allowing that this process can occur, does occur, will occur and providing yourselves the latitude to manifest this aspect of self. I encourage you to provide yourselves this space wherein you may experiment with this process. These experiments need not be for the benefit of others but rather they are to demonstrate to you that this process does in fact occur even to ones such as yourselves.\nI will point out that one of the greatest obstacles we face in this exercise is the limitation of self confidence. It is deeply ingrained within your society and culture that you are only human, just human, by all means just simply human and I tell you that you are human but as a human you have a component which is vast and timeless, eternal and divine. that is part of your makeup as human beings. Therefore I encourage you to shift your feet of identity to one of a child of God with a grand destiny, not a mere mortal of the realm who will never rise to the stature of divinity.\nYou will all rise to the stature of divinity as that is your destiny. You are designed to do exactly that if you would allow this as possibility. You have so long conditioned yourself to believe that this could never happen to one the likes of you or one so human but I tell you this is exactly what will happen to you. If it does not happen in this classroom, then in perhaps the next or the next but this is your destiny and your alignment with your divine fragment is your avenue of approach to your divinity.\nMake every attempt to give your fragment greater latitude in your lives. Create the space wherein this fragment may be, may be recognized by you, may be embraced by your concepts, may be allowed by your mind to exist. This represents our greatest challenge, to simply allow that this is real and by choosing this and allowing this to be real, it is real. If you choose not this avenue then it will not be part of your experience. This avenue which is yours awaits your choice, awaits your intention and is entirely passive throughout this process.\nBut having chosen this avenue, activate it, you charge it, you infuse it and then you may function in partnership with it. There is our lesson plan, that is our goal and we will make this goal to allow, to accept, to empower, to be those beings that we were empowered to be.\n",

        "title": "The Dual Role of Student & Teacher",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  While it is very true it is the desire of our hearts to follow where we are led, likewise do we as followers lead for others who are looking for the way to follow.\nEach one of us has a dual role to fulfill, one of student and follower and another of teacher and leader with that which we have become familiar with in this process. This combination of learning and teaching cements these lessons into place and provides even greater depths of understanding for the ones who must explain what they know, who must identify what they perceive. In this way we are switching back and forth, engaged in learning new perspective, reaching for new ideals, and then turning around and helping those behind you who have not been exposed to these lessons or these ideals and becoming the broker of such information as we have attained.\nThis is both a duty as a student and a privilege as a teacher. We must maintain our studies and pursuits so that we are current and up to date on our spiritual understanding, and as a result we find ourselves often in a position of relaying what we know to others, finding concepts to facilitate communication of ideals. I perceive in this group that many times you switch back and forth without giving a thought which mode you are in, at times feeling strong and certain and possessing great conviction in your understanding, and then other times you are switched over to yearning, seeking, and searching for answers. This is a healthy habit for you to maintain, being ever willing to switch to become the student or perhaps take a turn at being the teacher.\nThis skill will prove quite valuable to you as we move forward with our group ascension. We should always be ready to lend a hand to another or receive a hand from another. All this is the result of such great grace bestowed from on high that we should have these roles to fill, should be able and willing to be reliable members of this ascent team. Of the many things I am thankful for I count this group as one among my cherished blessings. I perceive that you all have a special place in your hearts for those of us who have volunteered to provide you with our services from the other side of the curtain. Isn't this a wonderful example of grace when we both cherish so deeply the gifts we have been given? That always brings us to a state of thanks. Thank you all. Thank you, Father. Thanks for the love and the grace and the peace\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I commend you for your exploration of the meaning of the presence of the Thought Adjuster and the idea of God as a personality. They are important concepts to have some grasp of to help you in your understanding of your quest, your journey homeward to one day, many millennia from now, to reunite with your source, with your Creator Father, your Paradise Father.\nIt is a unique opportunity in your world on Urantia to encounter these ideas in such a fashion that you may intellectually begin to comprehend the concepts of the Thought Adjuster and the meaning of the gift of personality. Without personality you would all simply be fragments of the Divine Creator which will one day reunite, much as the droplets of moisture in the clouds eventually reunite with the ocean. They will then evaporate again and return through the cycle over and over without moving onward. You however are on a continuous journey. Your personality provides you a vehicle of expression, of interaction with one another and with unseen personalities, and eventually on to the Father.\nThis fellowship of which you read this evening... words are a hollow expression… it would in fact not be possible to have relationship except between personalities. It is a fundamental and divine expression of creation, a vehicle for sharing and expanding truth within the vehicle of the mind. The intellectual capacity of the evolving mortal mind is augmented by the personality, by the presence of attributes such as curiosity, yearning, divine love of the very creation in which the mortal lives, appreciation of beauty, a comprehension of goodness.\nPersonality serves many functions on many levels throughout all the universes. Yet one of perhaps the most enduring qualities is that it provides great diversity, variety, interest, endless diversification of color and fragrance of all beings that are endowed with personality. You may think of yourselves as colorful, delightful, interesting, and unique. All of these descriptions apply to every individual. Personality is indeed a gift to be appreciated, to rejoice with thanksgiving that you have this possession, uniquely your own. Learn to appreciate your unique personality traits. Even those which at times seem to hinder you are your unique signature, your unique expression, in your world and throughout all of your ascension progress.\nIt is my hope that you have gained some appreciation for my personality and the personalities of those teachers with whom you have associated. It is through the sharing of energy association that the feelings of the reality of unique personality are conveyed. So there need not be a visible, physical vehicle to contain the personalities interacting for the reality to be shared… for unique personalities to interact and to know one another, to be recognized at another time.\nThe Paradise Father has seen fit to create endless colorful divine… there is no word to describe the rainbow of expression that is manifest, even in the limitations of your physical world. It is something to be celebrated and embraced as a divine gift. These coming days appreciate your own unique personality and that of those around you. Appreciate even the aspects of personality that you may not find are your favorite aspects to embrace. For they too are part of that individual to be loved as part of the whole. You are all one, are you not? It is an intellectual knowing, but appreciating another’s personality and fostering fellowship between you helps you to bring into actual awareness this oneness of which we speak. Begin in your one small corner of the world to embrace all personalities as brothers and sisters, connected with your own personality into a greater whole.\nThis is my assignment to you my dear friends. Go in peace.\n",

        "Body": "MONJORONSON: It is a blessing to address you, concerning this. The Thought Adjuster cannot be what it is not. It is from the source of love; it is from the source of harmony. Expressions of compassion, caring, love, harmony, order, forgiveness, and all the other wonderful virtues of a developed spirit are eminent, are present, are always there with the Thought Adjuster. It is, in itself a pre-personal being having a capacity that is far greater in its complexity, in its developed stature of spiritual enlightenment, than you can conceive. Think of it from the perspective of the Thought Adjuster, not that it would actually ask this question, \"How could such a lowly being as you have a personality, and I have not? How generous it is that the Creator, from which I come, and from which it [personality] comes, fills you with personality and I have not? This is the wonderful, motivating energies for our union, for our oneness, for our travels together in the infinite eras of time and eternity, as we grow to grasp what I have you want; what you have I desire, knowing that in the eventuality of our travels together in our experiences as we go through these many life plateaus and changes, we will become closer and more one.\"\nThe fusion of the Thought Adjuster with the mortal does not end this quest, does not end this development, but it continues to mature and grow.' How is this possible? It is a mystery. I will leave it at that. This is a magnificent, magnificent, wonderful, mystery of the universe, and you only will understand it more thoroughly and completely, almost in the totality, in the embrace with the Creator, when we are embraced together\", speaking as the Thought Adjuster that you have within you.\n\"Then you can appreciate fully why the Creator has sent out to the ends of time and eternity in the finite universe, these fragments, seeding the whole universe with fragments of itself, to come into being in wholeness, through these fragile, mortal fragments of life as yourself. It is a journey of exploration, of completion, of fullness. Then the ecstasy of knowing personality, from which the source has provided to you, becomes one with me, the Thought Adjuster. What a glorious, simultaneous, implosion, explosion of energy, as this develops! It is not an easy concept or process to follow or understand, but one which will become appreciable to you in its great magnificence in the ends of time\". Thank you.\nStudent: Thank you! Everything you have shared with us today has been very helpful.\nMONJORONSON: You are welcome. I, Monjoronson, am privileged to be here with you, to take on this grand and awesome and challenging task of helping you heal your personal life, and your world, together. I wish you well, my friends, and I am as present with you as the Spirit of Christ. The companionship that he provides to you when you call upon him is immediate and personal. Do not forget that! And my assistance is to work with you and Christ Spirit in healing this world. You are an essential part of that. You are important. You are needed, and your steadfast faith, appreciation, acceptance, trust and knowing that this will be so, even if you do not see it in your lifetime, is needed to support these efforts. And do not be afraid to share this message with others, for there is great fear upon your planet, and in fear there is resistance and separation and isolation. Be prepared to embrace those who show some meager amount of willingness to join. I bless you; Christ Michael blesses you; Nebadonia fills you with her presence, and the peace of our creator, may it preside always in your life. Good day.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I delight in witnessing the coming together of so many bright lights. It is as a beautiful constellation in the sky to witness.\nI would deliver a few short comments today on circuitry.\nWe are all now availing ourselves of a series of circuits, even wire towers, satellites. We know this as our phone circuitry that we access in order to be the final link in our connection here in this hour. This t/r has agreed to provide access to a circuit which enables me to function in partnership with him and provide this message. Similarly there are other circuits involved. Your individual presences scattered about this country represent a circuit in and of itself and your contribution you make to this circuit bring great energy and power into this arena.\nAs well you each have access and availability to your own private encircuitment with your inner voice, your inner guide, your adjuster. This circuit is waiting to be activated. It is functioning already but simply underutilized at this time. As well you are part of larger circuitry, your divine Parents encircuit you, your Mother gives you your life and everything in it, your Father brings you your eternal spirit. Your Divine Parents are always encircuited with you but similarly these circuits are underutilized.\nI point to the various levels of circuitry so that we may begin to activate multiple layers of circuitry at will with our intention. All of these circuits are present and available to you and it is going to become a focus of this Magisterial mission that we actively choose to participate in activating numerous levels of circuitry until you are entirely encircuited.\nThis is what our mission is directly before us. It is both an individual mission and a collective mission. Each one must of their own accord pay attention to their abilities at encircuitment and collectively we have the power to infuse energy into these circuits and make them come alive. They are part of your heritage and your birthright as children of God and we are now privileged to engage in the process of their discovery and implementation. In order to proceed we must first attempt to identify the various circuitry and as a result we may then gain enough familiarity with the different avenues of approach that we may be able to pick and choose and stimulate into function those circuits we desire.\nIt is as a series of \"when’s\" in which you are an anchor point. If you could visualize that you are positioned where many strands of this web come to your location and anchor, and like the spider you can feel all that happens anywhere on the web by virtue of this circuitry. We will use many forms of visualization and description to provide you of avenues of focus to allow your mind something to consider while your souls are simply seeking to feel.\nIt is our mission to form the most magnificent webs ever on this planet. We shall be about this mission with purpose and intention and we shall be successful in spreading far and wide these circuits of love and light, this web of attachment to each other and our efforts shall be infused from on high with the divine energies.\nI would offer a practice exercise and I would delight in any of those who would join me in this exercise. On a daily basis, if you would project your energies to be with me, then I will project my energy to be with you, and we shall meet and together, we shall project our energy out and we will spin these webs together. I will help you, I will show you, I will work with you, we shall do it together. If you will spend this time with me we will get to know each other better and we will gain experience in the projection of our will and the implications of that.\nI will raise your awareness as to your potentials and your powers when projecting your will. You vastly underestimate your capabilities in this regard and I wish to tutor those who would arrive together with me.\n…I would encourage you each to pick a place in your mind that you are comfortable and project to be into this place and as well project a place for me to be there with you. I will attend any place you choose, any time you choose and I desire most to commune with you and also that you provide opportunity for what you would call a download. This provides the options of our communion to be one of spiritual infusion as well and if you so desire to write, if this is helpful to you, then by all means, but foremost make yourselves comfortable that you may sit and wait for the truth, as it were.\n…I desire to meet and greet all those who enter the arena of spirit. I applaud your efforts that have brought you to this place at this time. If you are here, this message is meant for you. I give you my promise that I will abide by my word and meet with any who will meet with me regarding these matters of spiritual enlistment and spiritual download to the soul.\nThis process is paramount to all other processes and you will find that there is great assistance available to you when you have committed yourself to the process. Indeed the universe is structured to be here for you at this time. Ask and you shall receive my friend as you do in this hour. So shall it be whenever hearts and souls are aligned with your intentions to discover spirit.\nIf you are here this is you, so I speak to directly and plainly that we need you in this process to be our spiritual ambassadors, our liaisons to your world. This is not to place overdue burden upon you but rather to offer you the privilege of a universe and I am aware that you are up to the call.\n…Many avenues of approach are becoming available and we will access any of them and all of them to approach you in any manner possible. That is the latitude we have been granted in this Magisterial mission and that is what we will do.\nWe will implement circuitry that exists now, we will create new circuitry. We will not stop until all those who have ears to hear are spiritually encircuited. This is our mission and this is yours as well. So thank you for joining in this mission and creating this circuitry right now.\n…I would offer once again some imagery. In your mind’s eye travel with me if you will. We are gathered together on the hillside at the base of a great and glorious mountain before us. We gather at this base camp together to discuss techniques and approaches to ascend the mountain before us, that is what we do at base camp. That is what we have done here tonight together. We are discussing our tools that we have, our approaches that we might use, what might be done, what might be achieved, how best to achieve it and how do our work together in this process. Our web, our circuit that we are building is the rope that we will all be attached to as we make this ascent. It is our safety net from one to the other so that we may be joined together in this process and as we make this climb together, as we proceed up this trail we will be reevaluating these tools that we use, those techniques that we know, those concepts that we understand and those that are as yet unfamiliar to us. This is the journey of a lifetime and we are privileged to have arrived at this place together to discuss such a journey and to prepare.\n",

        "title": " Fear: A Most Significant Obstacle",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I would spend this time in the circle today in discussion of perhaps the most significant obstacle or challenge that we face as we prepare to depart the familiar surroundings of this base camp we enjoy, and that is the challenge of fear. Fear is ever present in your human paradigm and is only vanquished through the application of the human mind to override what is in fact a more basic response.\nThe first objective and step in freeing yourself from the domination of fear is to identify this reaction when it arises to confront you. This natural reaction may very well arise as a first response to any condition of uncertainty, but it is how you choose to react to this response which determines the effectiveness of your control over such a response. When at first you are confronted with this basic fear response and you have successfully identified that you are undergoing such exposure to this response, you then must decide whether or not to be led by such a response or whether you have sufficient control to maneuver your way around or through such a response by first identifying that you have felt fear. You next must make the choice to be led or prompted by this fear or to actively minimize the effect that this fear will have on your actions.\nAn example in our upcoming climb would be when you find yourself discerning a certain level of seriousness about your technique in climbing, fear presents itself as a mechanism for sharpening your senses and providing the necessary drive to function at the peak of your abilities. However, should fear be allowed to dominate you in this same situation, you may very well become paralyzed and unable to move forward because fear has so gripped you as to render you helpless.\nTherefore should we ever be on guard for the role that fear has to play in our upcoming ascension. Fear as a motivator can act quite effectively as a stimulant, but allowed to become a dominant force it will quite effectively impede your further progress. It therefore becomes your responsibility to address this issue of fear using the tools you have at hand to govern this fear, to even redirect this fear to a more useful realm. You have several tools you have learned to enable you to wrestle with this fear such as turning this fear over to Michael, such as the sheer force of your human mind will to command fear to be subservient to your wishes, such as -- techniques I would borrow from this mind frame construct -- washing your fears away as in a shower.\nTo actively take steps to cleanse yourself of the burden of such fears may be a useful tool as well. Whatever tool will work the best for you I encourage you to become familiar with its use. There will be times approaching when you all will be confronted with very basic fears for your own survival and for the survival of those around you.\nIt is necessary of any good climbers that they have command over such fears of life and limb that they may be effective climbers and therefore secure life and limb. To any climbers if fear were to dominate completely they would never ascend. You all have embraced that there will be uncertainty and, yes, even fear.\nI encourage you to prepare for such impending realities with the comfort and the security of the faith that you have also grown. This faith can still the choppy seas of doubt. It can calm the nerves and the mind and the soul allowing you to regain focus to see the next step clearly. Do not allow fear to become more than a stimulant to propel you on to the next move.\nI trust that each of you here will have command of such basic responses, but I do caution you that you will be confronted as the climber is with the knowledge of your human frailties and the frailties of those around you.\nHold fast to your faith. Do not be shaken from your climb. Realize that you are within the grasp of the divine, and press on in the certainty that you are cared for and that all the doubt you may encounter is transient and testing of your skill. I feel the eagerness in your hearts and it brings me great joy. I would that you feel my energy, my presence, that you may become familiar and comforted as we huddle together and speak of what is ahead.\nWe are here to support each other, and we will as a team make this ascension. I thank you each one for allowing me in your space, in our space. I look forward to time spent together as we bond and become closer and closer. What glory awaits as we rise to the top and witness all that we have accomplished. I cherish that moment and each moment from now until then.\n",

        "title": "This New Age Compared to Others",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  As you know all things have cycles and all things ebb and flow. Some cycles finish, other cycles begin and we find ourselves now together at quite a juncture, a crossroads if you will. One age, the age of materialism, the age of darkness, the age of uncertainty, the age of unawareness about who you even are, the age of fear, the age of doubts and the use of this fear to control and manipulate, this age has run it's course. You have been provided with enough contrast. There is enough darkness that you can perceive the contrast between this state and the state of light that you yearn for.\nEvery age runs it's course and then the objective of the age is reached and a new age dawns and is inaugurated. We are at this time, this dawning and inauguration of a new age of a different time. This age will be characterized by the opposites of the characteristics of the previous age. This will be an age of light, an age of understanding, an age of awareness, an age of creativity, an age where love reigns supreme and as a result all human activities will reflect these new values. Therefore this necessitates much change in the current working scenario.\nFirst and foremost you all must be reminded of who you are. You are children of light; you have divine parents who have created you to be divine beings. They have accommodated you with a material experience and manifestation of materialism and you have tasted darkness, doubts, fears and uncertainties. These are one side of the spectrum of possibilities but you have not been properly shown the other side of the spectrum. You have not seen truly the light; you have not experienced completely the love. Your awareness does not include the very reality that you are divine co creators each one. You have assumed that you are helpless, that you are but a mere speck of insignificance in the cosmos, that you are forsaken and forgotten and therefore powerless and under the thumb of those who wield the control.\nThis is all going to change swiftly and soon. This requires that you each one wake up and realize that you are a spiritual being merely having a material experience and that you are of divine lineage. Your parents are limitless creators and you are growing up to be such as them. Your destiny is completely under your control although you do not fully know that yet; likewise your planets destiny is as well yours to be created and not some events that are thrust upon you. But until you recognize this connection, until you can be made aware of this alternate reality it is not held against you that you do not know what you do not know. That, my friends, is where we find ourselves at this juncture.\nIt is my mission, my mandate, to change this scenario; to raise your awareness, to elevate your understanding of these most basic principles and to expose you to the other end of the spectrum so that you may see who you really are, you may see the light, you may feel the love. Once you do, all things in your lives are changed, nothing can possibly remain the same, remain untouched because you will be so changed, you will be so raised up by this new awareness that it will infuse new meaning into everything, even your most material of pursuits. When this happens collectively on a large scale we will see magnificent changes happen everywhere even to your environment that you have seen as so stable and predictable.\nEverything will change but as your Father has just told you it matters not to those who are born of the spirit and who know that their unchanging aspect is quite safe, quite protected, quite nurtured from on high. This should help you be bold when the dominos begin to fall very shortly and you perceive many changes around you that appear to be harsh or forced. Reflect what your Father just told you that contained within all circumstance there is the potential for divinity. We will ride out this wave together and you will one day consider it fortunate beyond description that you were here at this time to experience such a wealth of experiences as you will encounter as we make this flip together.\nIt will be quite a ride for those who are unaware that such cosmic cycles are shifting but that is where your opportunities for service will come in. You can bring to all the others your conviction, your certainty that all will be well. Your faith in your divine parents that this is only process, that it is not punishment or wrath but simply process of evolution and change. Knowing this should bring you comfort and this comfort, this peace is your calling, is your mission, it is your opportunity to be an expression of this peace to the others. Let them see you maintain your composure, let them witness you strong in your faith; let them find you bold in your assertion that all is well.\nYou know this deep within; you are merely being awakened to this calling. Each one of you is a new center, a new hub and all those around you will see your peace. They will perceive your grace and they will be drawn to you to ask where is it that you find such strength, such peace, such grace even in the face of such change and you will report to them that you have found this within, you have found your connection to your divine parents, you have found who you are and what your mission is, what your opportunity is and in so doing you will be a beacon to all, a lighthouse in their storm and they will seek you out, they will find you and when they find you let them find their family, their parents that you know.\nYou share the same parents; let them find them through you. Truly all is well my dear ones and in this hour all is spectacular. Hold fast to the memory of this spiritual encounter and petition such an encounter at any time you so desire. Do not hesitate to call upon myself or your parents or your indwelling fragments, the representative of The Father of all. Do not hesitate to call for any of us if you stumble or if you merely need reassurance or comfort. We are ever ready to swoop in and surround you with our presence and literally raise your vibration level.\n",

        "title": "Opening to New Realities that “ All things are Possible”",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  As a matter of necessity for us to establish new patterns as we co- create this next level of ascension it will be required of each of us that we engage in those activities heretofore unrecognized as a matter of routine by those inhabiting this sphere.\nWhen we are asked to engage in new patterns and promote unique ideals it will be perceived by definition that we are involved in the co-creation and promotion of that which would be defined as miracles or miraculous. The question I pose to each of you is: are you prepared to embrace what in your perception would be defined as a miracle simply because it has been outside your realm of reality?\nToday I will continue with that thought. Your physical form is much like the flour, and your mind is much like the water. It is the flexibility of your mind that allows it to integrate into the solid structure of your body to animate it and to integrate it into a united functioning organism. Life itself is much like the kneading wherein mind and body are continually interacting and interfacing with the external world, in this analogy the breadboard upon which you are pressed and massaged and softened.\nWill you remain faithful enough to be steadfast in your pursuit of our ascent even when you are called upon to co-create a new and different approach? Will you each one be resolute in your application of that which you are familiar with in the approach to that which is now unknown to you?\nWill your faith extend beyond your comfort zone? Will you have the ability to embrace that which is now currently uncertain to you? These are the questions that I would ask that you ponder of yourself. In hearing your discussion earlier I recall to you that matters that now are familiar to you and of which you now have some certainty were at one time distant and unfamiliar.\nI would ask you to recall the transition that each of you made in coming to realization in overcoming your uncertainty, in challenging your doubts in pursuit of higher truths. These qualities will be asked of you as we proceed forward. It will be required of you that you extend the faith that you have grown to even greater boundaries, boundaries that will include things that you might now consider outside the realm of possibility. I would ask you to strengthen your faith muscles to enable you to not only approach that which you are as yet unfamiliar with but even to embrace these new levels of reality.\nIt is not as though all that you think of as beyond your realm does not exist as reality on some level, it is simply that you as individuals have not embraced these patterns, realities, and ideals which are currently just outside your reach. There are many of these reality patterns which will become within your grasp should you allow yourselves the ability to embrace them through the extension of your faith that it is indeed possible. Many of the limitations before us as we proceed are in fact internal limitations placed by your perception of what is or is not possible.\nI invite you to open yourselves up to the possibility that all things are possible, that the only limitations placed upon you are placed there by you, that if the Father so desires that something be made so, it can be made so. I ask each of you to spend some time in reflection of your personal boundaries of faith, because, as we proceed forward as climbers, we will encounter situations wherein we are uncertain as to how to proceed given the existing patterns that we are familiar with.\nTherefore in order to proceed we must be open to the establishment of new patterns that we are currently unfamiliar with. This acceptance of that which is currently unknown to us is achieved through the faith that simply because we are unaware to this new dimension of reality does not at all imply that this new pattern or dimension does not exist, only that we are currently unaware of it.\nTherefore it will be required of us that we be open to new ways, new ideals, new patterns, and new approaches as we make ourselves available for such to be made real in our lives. This is typically done in spurts of growth in the human condition wherein you become comfortable with a certain level of understanding and then as a matter of your choice you encounter a growth spurt wherein you extend your faith to accommodate that which you were previously unaware of, and then you grow accustomed and familiar with your new parameters until you are ready to extend your boundaries once again.\nThis is where we find ourselves at this juncture. It will become necessary that we extend our boundaries once again to enable us to embrace even broader patterns of reality that we may be more successful in our upcoming ascent. Ponder where your boundaries lie and your receptivity to extend your faith to allow you to once again push your boundaries and allow yourselves to encompass a greater spectrum of that which is that you may have control over, a broader spectrum of that which is.\nHaving extended yourselves you acquire command over the next level of reality that awaits you. That is enough to ask of my comrades in this ascension party on this day, and I would remind you that this is nothing more than you have repeatedly shown your willingness and your ability to do in the past. But you are coming to the awareness that this is going to be required of you over and over to extend yourselves further and further. Once again we find ourselves requiring of you that you exhibit your faith as you have so willingly done to this hour that we may even discuss this.\n",

        "title": "The Process of My Incarnation",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Good afternoon, this is Monjoronson. Today I wish to speak to you about my incarnation—more directly to the process of incarnation, which applies to myself. You have heard the quote from Mark Twain, have you not, that when he read his obituary, he said that his death had been over-rated. I wish to tell you that my incarnation is being under-rated. It will occur! It is not a matter of \"if,\" but \"when.\"\nYour Creator Son, upon his Sovereignty invoked the development that would lead to my presence here on your world, a further example of his love for you—and to all of Nebadon—that this example would be used as an illustration to all planets, of his largess, of his love for you, his compassion and his mercy. He is without bounds in his will to help you rise above your human nature, and to rise into your god self, which is not inevitable, but is assured with your decision to incorporate that into your life. Incarnation of a descending Son sometimes occurs instantaneously. This occurs in these instances for specific purposes, for particular reasons, for the accomplishment of an intention and before specific goals. Other incarnations occur over time. While deity is all knowing, deity is without experience. Your presence in the universe is the desire for God to know itself, and like-wise, for you to know God. The adventure is similar for you both.\nMy incarnation will be done slowly. I will not come here and sit on the doorstep at Garland Street, and appear over weeks or instantaneously, but come to your world many times—sometimes for the duration of a millisecond, sometimes for the duration of seconds and minutes. Sometimes I will come as a wave of energy that is invisible to you; sometimes I will be here, only in the presence of myself—consciousness that you can feel. Other times, I will begin to coalesce and practice that. This is an experience. This is part of the descending Son program, of God knowing what it is like to transform from God, to a mortal being. There is an experiential benefit for doing this, for God, for your world, and for myself.\nThis is very similar in some ways to the experience of Machiventa as the Melchizedek of Salem, so many years ago when he taught Abraham and the other leaders at that time. He came here instantaneously, walked into their camp and began to reveal God’s truth to them, as they could understand it. He came away from that experience as an experiential being, having lived here, having tasted food, smelled the odors and fragrances around him and known the companionship of others in his presence. He hugged them; he loved them, and they loved him. This is a very vital, experiential process, one to be savored, like a good wine. It is something that comes with many nuances, many other flavors, many things that stimulate your consciousness, your thoughts and begin to align other thoughts and ideas in your mind, with others that make a larger concept and insight.\nSo, too, am I here to experience this slowly, to savor coming into the material life slowly, to savor its fragrance, to savor its flavors, to the visions, the hues, to the colors of your lives, to feel the nuances of a harsh touch and a gentle touch, to learn to know what it is like to be a human, to be mortal. I am here to add much experience to God the Supreme’s completion, just as you are. It is a way of experiencing this transition with élan, with quality, with dignity, with character. This is a hallowed experience for me. This is a wonderful experience for your world, to add to its consciousness, and my presence here will add to the consciousness of humankind, for I will add much to it because I want to and I will to. This is in keeping with the development of your world.\nWe wish to upgrade the flavor, the fragrance, the vision, and the color of your world in its consciousness. We wish to wash away the drab, dark, colorless nature of its prior existence during this quarantine, during its influence from Caligastia, Lucifer, and Satan. We wish to bring light to your world. I will do this slowly. I will inhabit your world, my friends; I will be with you; I will be \"one\" with you, and you will know that oneness. I truly tell you, that when you feel this oneness that \"you\" are part of the universe, that you have an eventual position as a citizen of the universe, that you are already anticipated. You will feel that, know that, and yearn for its completion, even though you have a mortal life ahead of you that must not be rushed, must not be completed too early. You, as well, must incarnate yourself in your Thought Adjuster’s image in this world, in this life that you have, as best you can. Make your decision well, and will yourself to become the fulfillment of God’s will, in the duration of your years. Good day.\n",

        "title": "Understanding the TR Process",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I will attempt to minimize the amount of mystery surrounding this process that we are using in this moment referred to as the Transmitting/Receiving process. The overall component of this process is a partnership that is engaged in, in this case by myself and a willing partner who has the particular arrangement of willingness and receptivity to allow for such a circuit to be utilized in this process.\nAs was referred to in the opening prayer offering, this coming together of spirit and material realms is accomplished with the full consent and awareness of both parties. As such, each party in such a partnership brings into the equation their characteristics, their personality, their traits, their levels of awareness, and they bring them to this meeting of partners. Each makes available to the pool of resources what they have to offer and this includes on the mortal side of the equation, the basic understanding and awareness of the material realm and whatever information, facts or understandings, the mortal may possess.\nThis portal is quite restricted in that the mortal of the realm must have a most basic recognition of the subject matter in discussion and as well must be unattached to their understanding of it enough to allow for the divine overlay of superior pattern. So, in this way the true connection results in the mortal awareness and contribution of spiritual truths and principles, and somewhere in this combination, in this partnership, there is reached a common zone of overlap.\nMake no mistake that one who is acting in the capacity of Transmitter/Receiver is not at all absent personally from the equation; rather, we are drawing on their basic awareness and understanding, their vocabulary, and their willingness to be open to that which may not be within their sphere of awareness. The mortal understanding may be used as a springboard to reach a more spiritualized awareness, but it is required that there be a willingness, a partnership between the two in order for this transformation to occur.\nThis is why any transmitter/receiver will carry with them a signature of personality that will be prevalent in all partnerships that they are present in. Likewise do individuals such as myself or Michael or any of the other celestial personalities whom you may be in contact with, have their own personality signatures which will be present regardless of who the transmitter/receiver partner may be at any time.\nThis is a point well made because one needs to be discerning of the characteristics of the different energy signatures and grow to identify the personality signatures and distinguish them from the personality signatures of the individual Transmitter/Receivers. I must make it clear that under no circumstances, at any time, does a celestial personality commandeer even a willing partner to override the freewill of any individual. This is simply not within the mandate or parameters of this process.\nThe material body remains under the jurisdiction of the mortal who is inhabiting that body. They may become altered or transformed as a result of their contact with spirit personalities and as a result they may do things differently or act differently than previously observed but this is in no way as a result of demands made on the mortal by the spiritual partner. Such demands simply do not exist. Your free will reigns supreme throughout the universe and throughout all eternity.\nYou should know this is sacred and will never be abused in any way when dealing with the higher spiritual personalities. The only time your free will will ever be infringed upon is in this material life if you are unfortunate enough to be under the jurisdiction of others who would take away your free will, your rights as you refer to them, and impose their ways upon you in the mortal realm. That is the only way that your free will may be impinged upon at any time.\nIt simply cannot happen from a spiritual perspective, because it is well known throughout the spiritual realm that this gift of the Father, this free-will choice is supreme in value and never to be infringed upon by another who is in awareness that this is the case.

        "title": "You Are a Complex Being with Gifts Bestowed Upon You",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Let us lay out some of the basics in as plain a language as can be had in this process. You are identified by means of your individual personality which is a gift from the First Source and Center and this identifies you as a unique individual in all of time and space with your own combination of personality traits. You then have along with you access to the First Source and Center which is provided through that aspect of yourself you would identify as the Thought Adjuster or your indwelling guide.\nThis is the avenue of approach you use to approach the First Source and Center. Also you have another gift freely bestowed by your Creator, the Son, and this gift of your Michael Son, the Spirit of Truth is as well a method of approach to Michael and his personality. You too have a third divine presence and that is of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Spirit. This has as part of it's constitution your mind circuitry as well as your material being.\nThis combination of gifts which constitute your being are all now temporarily housed in this vehicle, in the material time and space realm. When you attempt to identify these different aspects of you, you may seek distinct and separate personalities to identify but this would be in error because none of these gifts which have been given to you carry with them their own personality, rather they are more like influences.\nThere is but one personality resident within you, your individual personality, but there are means given to you by virtue of the gifts which provide you avenues of approach, one to the First Source and Center, one to your Creator Father and one to your sustaining Mother Spirit. So if you are seeking distinct different personalities to look for, you will not find them because the personality that they will identify with is yours and therefore they are hard of individual distinction.\nWhen you ask about the Holy Spirit, it is most familiar to you as your mind circuit and your nurturing environment and existence. When you consider the Spirit of Truth, it is most evident in your approach to knowing Michael and when you speak of attempting to identify your Thought Adjuster, it is your attempting to identify that fragment of the First Source and Center. All of this is done around this nucleus of life that was granted to you in the form of your individual personality.\nAnd so it is that when you are most experiencing your interface with the Spirit of Truth, you are coming closest to your awareness of Michael and will register his personality and in this way it is possible to feel Michael's presence as you access this avenue of approach. Michael's presence knows no restriction of time or space and his omnipresent nature allows for him to respond to all those who will utilize this avenue of approach.\nIt is this that he uses to bring his influence and gain access to you as you so invite him through your opening of this avenue of approach. I hope this has been helpful in defining some of the components that were blended into this question for you are a complex being and it will take some time for you to even settle on all the components of self and their relationship to each other, but the fact that you are asking such questions is proof positive that you are engaged with these gifts which have been provided to you and it is a joy to see.\n",

        "title": "The Higher Mind",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I would speak to you briefly this evening, on the \"higher mind.\" Each of you possesses a higher mind. There are three components to mind: You are aware of the subconscious, and through your text, you are aware of the superconscious; you are aware of the dead-level of consciousness, through which you perceive your surroundings, make your decisions and live your lives. This superconscious concept is one that is most important, the concept of which most of your world is unaware. It is through this higher mind that you are able to perceive spiritual realities and process spiritual input.\nMost of the time this happens on a purely unconscious level and it happens more readily when you desire it and request [it]. During your times of quiet stillness, of sojourning with the Father, as it were, you may make this request, and your higher mind will be ministered to. When you are passing through your lives, intersecting with other personalities, conducting the business of your lives, keep a part of your conscious mind that is aware of the input of the higher mind. Create that \"bridge of intention\" between your conscious mind and your superconscious, and over this bridge, you can conduct spirit business in your daily lives.\nEnrich the stores of the higher mind through your stillness practice. I would encourage each of you, as you have been exhorted in the past, to create this time of stillness, once, twice a day, with the express purpose of activating the higher mind, creating the bridge and strengthening it. In these times of great change and turmoil, which are yet to go on for some time, those of you who choose to live in the light need every reinforcement of your spiritual connection, your spirit realities, so that you may remain strong and a bright light for your brethren, your brothers, your sisters—all those who need you very, very much, now and in the future. This is why we love you so very much, for you are willing.\nLove one another. Care for one another. Leave none behind. Strengthen each other spiritually, materially, intellectually. Be the listening ear. Be the loving heart. Be the one who reaches out. Be the one who says yes. Be the one who goes the extra mile. Demonstrate your higher mindedness; inspire your fellows; be the light. You are the light of the world. I thank you for your willingness. I know each of you, I lay my hand on each of you in love, [in] brotherhood. As you know and have guessed, there is more to be revealed. Our visits and sojourns with you are not to foretell the future, but to prepare you for changes ahead, changes in which you are already involved, changes which are quite evident in your daily news. We visit with you most especially to enwrap you in love, to reassure you, to cheer you and to strengthen you.\nI am Monjoronson. My work is proceeding; the work of my mission and it proceeds apace. I rejoice to visit groups, such as yours and others around this ravaged planet, these groups of light, these groups of love and hope. The flames and the light of the love will spread—are spreading—you shall see. And so I leave you now; I leave my peace with you; I leave my love with you and ask that you pass it on in everything you say and do. Good evening.\n",

        "title": "Understanding the Value to Different Aspects of Self",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  First I observed for discussion regarding your different aspects of self and your attempt to define and delineate these composite parts into their distinct and different category that you may the better understand the difference between what you referred to as your higher mind, your ego, and your soul. These distinctions are perhaps the human animal's greatest challenge, not only to define and distinguish, but then to control and even master, which we know is at any given time chosen and given latitude and brought to the fore.\nIn your attempts to describe these distinct and different components of the self it is necessary to use words which provide you with the necessary sense of contrast to allow you to feel as though you have identified and isolated such aspects. However, as with the use of any language, there is carried with definitions and denominations inherent judgment that is implied when using terms as \"higher\", \"lower\", as \"base\" and \"divine\", \"animal\" and \"spirit\". In your current phase of evolution you are all about reaching for higher, better, more divine principles, and it is quite natural to then assign those components of self which are less than these qualities a term which grows to imply inferior or less or wrong somehow. I would encourage you to monitor your observation of these terms so as to not overlay any negative connotations to your efforts to simply define and distinguish. As was mentioned, if all these aspects were not necessary and part of your divine composition, then they would not be with you.\n[The] Father has all aspects included in your composition and does not refer to any one as unnecessary or inferior or inappropriate somehow. For instance, one may refer to the aspect of ego and declare that it is in contrast to the higher mind and therefore needs to be dominated and perhaps even eliminated. This would be an inaccurate assessment of the value contained in such an element as you refer to as the ego. The part of you thus referred to is quite a necessary component in your current material experience. If it were not for your ego and its attempt at self preservation, you would not be here, as your ancestors would have been killed off due to their passive natures.\nYour ego is a useful tool for propelling you forward and motivating you to action, although it is quite true that there needs to be balance between your various components so as to bring into serviceability each aspect. If allowed to run rampant, any one aspect will cause an out of balance situation and will be unhealthy. You are living in a material realm and therefore your ties to your material existence serve you well. However, you are encountering the reality before you that there are other components of the self which are desiring to move you ever in a spiritual direction. Your soul is, of course, eternal and only encapsulated temporarily in your physical combination of atoms and as such is destined to transcend and travel beyond this material existence.\nIronically enough it is your ego that comes into play which you may use to motivate you to pursue spiritual avenues of pursuit, and therefore your material component can be an assistant to your spiritual component. The goal is that there not be struggle between the various aspects of self. The goal is that there is harmony and balance and that the different components of self may be as a musical chord, complimentary to each other, not as in discord where one of the elements is out of synch, out of tune, with the others. We should bless this diverse nature that you enjoy, and, while it is good to make attempts to identify the distinct aspects, the larger goal would be to unify the different aspects of self.\n",

        "title": "Ego as a Driving Force",
        "Body": "Mary: The first question this evening is submitted and says that for all outward appearances this questioner feels weak and limited but on the inside they feel powerful and invincible, eternal and Godlike.\nQuestion #1:  Is this an ego illusion or am I really identifying closer and closer with the Divine Spirit within?\nMonjoronson: Thank you very much for such a thoughtful question and such an important one because there does need to be made this distinction that you draw of wondering which part of you is being represented at any given time. This is a good and valid source for observation throughout your eternal career, exactly where are you coming from when you are seeing things from your perspective or your vantage point, your point of view. I can unequivocally assure you that if you are tuning into frequencies that feel Godlike and peaceful and eternal and secure, then you are genuinely experiencing the spiritual reality that your soul is looking to identify with and when it registers that it has found it, it locks on to those frequencies of truth, of beauty and of goodness.\nAnd so I wish to bring you some sense of security that when you have direct experience of such traits as these you may be assured that you are accessing your Divine Component, that you are experiencing this with your Spiritual Self and that this is truly the most real encounter you may ever have. Things that are of spiritual import and of genuine goodness endure forever. They are part of your treasure trove that you collect and accumulate and bring with you on your return trip to the Father.\nYou mention the common term, the ego, and you mention a concern that something having to do with your ego may possibly or even necessarily lead you away from what is sensed as goodness or beauty or truth. What I would gently offer to modify that perception, because what you refer to as your ego is more accurately termed your driving force. You have personality but personality may need a driving force before it is expressed and there is this force you refer to as the ego, because this force may be used for any purpose, to pursue goodness and beauty or to pursue those things which are not. Therefore you have witnessed ego travel in both directions. It makes good people very very good and it makes people with ill intentions very extreme. It is the same driving force in either direction.\nYour personality and your free will is what chooses the direction of this implementing of the driving force you call ego and so it may well be considered your most valuable tool and asset and should not be considered as faulty or shunned in any way. It is an aspect of you, a valuable component and like other valuable components of your being it may need to be brought under your control more mindfully and more successfully. It is no different than many other tools, you must choose how to use it, how much to use it, when not to use it, when to watch out for its influence and when to ask for and accept its influence when you need the courage to go on, the strength to pursue, the drive to move forward. These are what you get from that aspect, that driving force that may be used to propel the creative aspects of the personality and express them out in time and space.\nI hope a perspective such as this will help you to make friends with all your distinct and different and valuable components or aspects of yourself because they would not be part of you if they were not intended as part of the divine plan. You must figure that all parts work for the eventual good of the whole and that you would not be given such a thing as an ego if you did not need at times a driving force to propel you in your desires. So it is not to overcome or disregard, it is to accept the partnership and work with the aspects for its strength and be mindful of its limitations.\nThank you very much for this question because it is an extremely important distinction and illustration to draw. This teasing out of the different parts of yourself may be useful in terms of structuring your awareness and understanding and I hope that my dialog has brought you a better understanding of the need to work together with all the aspects of the self and not be at odds with any of the parts of human nature. People even tend to scorn their animal side and wish that they did not have an animal component to their being and yet this is a cherished part of your growth and development only to be experienced here and now in this remote existence of time and space.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I have spoken much of resting at base camp in preparation for the ascent. You who are gathered attentively to my presence have for your first task the role of a gatekeeper. I do not speak of you as a gatekeeper in the manner of one who is the guardian of the gate who prevents entry. I speak of you as one who opens the gate, who makes clear the passage for the many who seek to enter. In the age to come, if Urantia is to attain such an age, all will enter. There is confusion upon Urantia, conflicting ideologies, selfish wars, and there are many on your world who are hungry for an answer, praying for peace. Many grope along the walls that separate this present era from the next looking for the portal. It is you, my associates, who are the ones who will say, \"Come. This is the way. Here is the door, let me open it. Take a look.\" So, our first mile in this ascent is to clear the path to the gate, to reveal to others its presence. You will point out this way by being visible on this newly cleared path. Those struggling in the brambles will find you in the clearing and will approach you. So, there will be a passage of time wherein all our effort is going to merely attracting many more to the open clearing wherein the gate is visible.\nEach one must pass of their own free will. Even my presence on this world is not a cure of magic, will not overlay Urantia with a new age of instant cure to all your problems. I do encourage each of you to put within your travel pack the tools required to clear the path to the gate of the new era.\nThese tools are the ones that can cut through delusion, through greed. They are tools that can illuminate truth when it is obscured by active falsification. Some of you will find the path rough and of difficult travel as it is freshly laid. But you, my fine ascenders, will compact this path and make the way an easy passage for those who follow. Your reward is the joy of recognizing the many ascending behind you who can proceed readily because of your efforts. Teach. Let your awareness of the values of spirit be known. Let your perspective of the order of the universe be known.\nOpinions prevail upon your planet, as many as there are minds to create them. Yours is as valuable in its expression as any others as you refine your view of cosmic reality and your position within it. The greater your alignment to truth, the more I admonish you to express your view, for, as the master said, you do not hide your light under a bushel. Place your floodlight upon the gate and let it be known that it is there that others may reorient their paths that they may proceed forthright. Once we have entered into this new realm, Urantia will seem quite different.\n",

        "title": "Letting Go of the Past",
        "Body": "Question: Hello Monjoronson, [hello] I wish to make a statement and maybe a question as well. I do acknowledge that one of the most trustworthy things in a humans life is their own experience and all planets [involved] with the Caligastia rebellion and the Adamic default I can imagine a planet that is settled in light and life does not have these erroneous concepts as a legacy coming over from the evolution that it is important that we are all safe.\nBecause of these rulers we inherit a season of distrust moving forward from that legacy so we being agondonters are trudging a different path regarding trust and the only thing that we can really be sure of is our own experience that we have lived.\nMonjoronson: Oh my friend, you have just provided a key. Let me please use your observations. You state that we observe that your human species bears the mark or stigma of its past and that it is a challenge to overcome such a stigma. I am welled up with the feeling that this is a key point to be made. At some point in your process, in your evolution both individually and collectively you must of necessity make a break with the past. The past is just that, it is past, it is history, it is not here, it is not now, it is not in this moment. What is in this moment is what you have referred to as your experience. Now, if you are strong creators and if it is your desire to create a new future for yourself, then part of what you must create is a break with tradition, a break with your past, a break with deception, a break with deceit, a break with distrust, a break with dishonor.\nYou understand that these things carried forward into this moment pollute your moment, they contaminate your environment and you are saddled with them as an obstacle to overcome before you can even begin to proceed with a new vision, a better vision, a higher vision of the way you would have it. Now, consider what stands in your way. As agondontors you have already shown that you have faith to believe in things unseen therefore do you have the faith to create the realities that are not currently known. You have the faith to forsake dragging the obstacles of the past into your now, into your current moment. You have the trust that you can do this. This is up to you, it is not future generations, it is not another time or another place. It is the moment that you decide that you will do this.\nYou are all rather fond of pointing to a time of light and life as something in the projected future, that it will be nice if it arrives one day and I will say to you that day begins today with your thought, with your trust, with your intention you create light and life even if it is only in the space around your physical being, even if it is only in your family; even if it is only on your block, you create it because you choose to create it. And so I encourage you to consider this turning of the page, this making a break with the way things were, because you cannot create the new way if you have a yoke around you of the way things were. It is true, we have history to consider. History that can help us put some perspective to our position but then we must free ourselves of its shackles. We must be about creating a new future, a new paradigm, a new awareness.\nThat is what I am here to usher in as are you. You are the ones who will have the bold new ideas of a more ideal future, then you are the ones who will take the steps to make it happen, you are the ones who will create it. It is not something that will be thrust upon you from on high, this state of light and life, it will come from you and you are now bolstering your courage and finding your voice and positioning yourself so that you may speak with the authority of one who has trust and faith and conviction. This is our privilege my dear ones, we are so very fortunate to be here together as this unfolds before us but also we must roll up our sleeves and be at work in this process. This is not granted to us, we must make it happen but when we show ourselves willing we have the vast recourses of the ocean behind us; and so be it, let us work together.\n",

This light of truth will expose motivations and objectives which contrast greatly with your higher ideals and principles. At that point it will be up to you to formulate your response to such contrasts and relativities. I would encourage you to maintain your faith and develop a posture of love and forgiveness for those who have betrayed your trust, as this course is the only one that will see this potentially tumultuous situation through. There will be a great many who will naturally assume attitudes of anger and frustration at having been misled and betrayed and will allow these responses to dominate.\nYou as lightworkers must practice tolerance, forgiveness, love, and exhibit great faith in all that transpires working out to the good. You must be islands of stability as those around you become unsettled in uncertainty. You must provide them the perspective that those who have fallen short of their duties and obligations are but small children on this playground of life and as such deserve compassion and forgiveness, as hatred and anger are never the solutions to a challenge of this sort. Therefore I leave you with the consideration as to how you will personally respond when this illumination of light shines into the places on this world that need it the most and provide the most opportunity for forgiveness, tolerance, service, and faith.\n",

        "title": "Forgiveness is an Exercise",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Forgiveness is an exercise; it is a label that you give to an exercise, both mental and physical for releasing that energy. To say, “I forgive you,” is just simply saying the words—there must be something more that underlies those words.\nWhen I say, “I bless you,” I send my energy, too, that fills your body, your mind, your being and your presence in all regards, so that you simply glow with blessing. So, too, must you release the energy in your body and in your mind when you say, “I forgive.” It is a drawing out of the poison, so to speak, of un-forgiveness, then releasing it to the universe to absorb.\nSo there is a duty involved in the process of forgiveness: one is to forgive the person who said something or did something offensive to you, knowing that they did not know any better; and second, is that you forgive yourself for reacting, because you did not know any better, and that you need to grow and learn to be more loving.\nFeeling offense is an energetic reaction of an un-evolved spiritual being.  \"You have work to do\" —this is what it says to you, when you feel angry at some situation for something that somebody said. It means that you have work to do. And then the question is, “What is this about in me? Where do I need to grow? What do I need to see to become more completely full, mature and evolved, so that I do not become angry and need to forgive someone else, and forgive myself and evolve?\"\nThe feelings that you receive from others, whether it is anger, resentment, jealousy, envy, lust or hate, are all reactions within you of incompleteness. They are statements that say, “I need to grow.” And the more you live in negative emotional reactions is a statement to your life that you need to grow immensely, to grow greatly. As you grow in fullness of your being—meaning the fullness of your capacity to love—these negative emotions will no longer pervade your being, but you will be filled and shot through with love and forgiveness, forbearance, tolerance and patience, to name only a few. These are the areas to grow into. As you grow in these positive values and positive emotional reactions, you will have grown in spirit, so that you will be un-offended by someone who has said something negative to you.\nOne is that they truly forgive that individual, knowing that that instant will always remain in memory. What is hoped for from your Guardians and your Thought Adjuster is that as you say, “I forgive,” you also defuse the energy in the image that is held in memory, so that it becomes a neutral memory—a photograph negative without energy—there is no color to it, it is simply black and white, it is static, it does not move, it is simply a recording in your mind without energy. All too often, people say, “I forgive you, but I do not forget,” meaning that they are ready and armed in the future for this person to act out again, and they hold energy about that. In other words, they have perhaps intellectualized their forgiveness without defusing the energy, and they are intentionally protecting themselves from acting out, that they remind themselves to hold this in memory, but have forgiven it, ready to pull the trigger on their unforgiveness in the future. Truly, if you say, “I forgive you but I will remember this,” and honestly say that you remember it but do not hold any grudges and readiness to strike out in the future, then you live in a spiritual reality that maximizes your capacity as a mortal of Urantia.\n",

        "Body": "Question #1:  What do we need to be ready for the Magisterial Mission?\nMonjoronson: Dear friend, by simply asking the question you have already begun to prepare yourself for my mission, the mission of myself, Machiventa and Christ Michael. You have said as much in your question that you are already ready to participate with us. Your openness to participate with us is essential. There is no published script for how this mission will unfold though you have already been told of the grand scheme of it all. Your place will be a major part as well because this is your part, this is something you can take ownership of, that you can know that you are contributing. You may never see the effects of your participation but you know that your intent and your sincerity are sufficient to carry your consciousness and energy forward to help the accomplishment of our work. I do not say my work, but our work, for this is a completely co-creative effort. I do thank you for your question.\nI would further state that you can further prepare by practicing the presence, being in meditation once or twice a day, being still and open to receive instruction and guidance which you may not hear but which may be given to you subliminally. Also prepare by reading good material that helps you understand the spiritual journey of others and the issues and problems and solutions that they find in their quest. These will be very helpful to help you keep an open mind to all that will unfold. It will also assist you to be in the right place at the right time so that you can complete meaningful contributions to our work. Thank you\n",

        "Body": "Question:  This is a question about missions outside of the Teaching Mission. What other efforts aside from the Teaching Mission and the Magisterial Mission are being taken by non-human personalities present on Urantia to bring awakening to large numbers of people? Is Abraham just teaching in the Teaching Mission or is he assisting elsewhere?\nMonjoronson: This question fits well within our discussion this evening, for the celestial ministers attending to this planet are working with the variable cultural contingencies existing upon your world. You are discerning in your questions that there are many avenues wherein these beings are engaged to bring about change upon the planet. Abraham and others are contacting individuals throughout your world through the means most receivable by those human beings. While I regard my mission here as a form of an umbrella mission in that it has a span of outreach that embraces all missions of contact, I regard all these efforts in whatever form that they are encountered to be of equal value, for we are functioning as a unified force. Our goal is not to be recognized by our mission but to bring each one of you into a new era of refined thinking, of improved relationships, of keen discernment, and a peacefulness in living your life.\nYou have many forms of stories in your literature; the episodes, the actions, that take place are variable, but oftentimes the plot has a moral that would be repeated over and over again. That ‘s what these missions of contact are doing, expressing the same moral to the story through all the variations that are comprehensible by human beings. Thank you for your interest in our work.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I tell you clearly and plainly that no darkness can withstand the focus of the Father's light. It is impossible for darkness to exist when there is light brought to bear.\nThis is the function and purpose that you may show to each other as we continue our exercises. You may be the lens through which the Father's light may shine down upon each other. When bathed in such light it is not possible for darkness to remain. Light always dissipates darkness. Cherish this, my friends, as your ultimate tool, your weapon against darkness that is present in your lives on your planet among your people. This tool you possess of focusing your beam of light and supplementing your beam with the Father's beam provides you with great power to dispel the darkness. It was your intentions and your focus which were the potent force used to bring the Father's love through His light and yours to those in need. It was a beauty to behold and witness.\nThere was an opportunity to test the ropes, and they not only held, they worked magnificently. Therefore will you all be more aware in how you may focus your beam of light in areas of darkness that they may be, one by one, dispelled. When there is enough light even the shadows disappear.\nAccept that you have a role to play in focusing this beam. As well accept the focus of this beam into your own lives. Be willing to allow this light from on high to dispel your own darkness and your own uncertainties, your own doubts, your own fears, because all of these are temporal and transient and no match for the infinite love light from on high. Allow yourselves the benefit of receiving such light and such love into your own being. Breathe in the Mother's life, feel the Father's light. Soak these in as they surround and infuse you with their love.\n",

        "title": "Seeing Through Spiritual Eyes",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Greetings, Monjoronson here… to play with the ball that is being tossed back and forth about seeing the spiritual vision. As you know one may see something with the eyes of the flesh, but one may have vision about things which are beyond the perception of the eyes of the flesh. It is calling into force another sense that you possess and using it to overlay what your eyes of the flesh may take in. It allows you to know the bigger picture. Where your eyes of the flesh may behold a brother or a sister before you, your eyes of spirit discern that this is a child of God with a fragment of divinity within.\nThis sense of knowing and feeling, this very truth causes you to act differently when you engage with this one who is before you, because you bring an added dimension of sight, even a dimension of insight, when you allow yourselves to be shown the circumstances with your eyes of the spirit.\nLikewise when you gaze out upon your world and all that transpires in your lives, you gaze out through your physical eyes which provide you with information regarding your surroundings, but you also gaze out on the world and all that transpires with a sense of knowing, of relationship, of purpose, of context, of understanding, even of wisdom. These things are derived from the use of your spiritual perspective.\nTo one who only uses their eyes of the flesh the circumstances surrounding your lives may appear quite random or shallow or disjointed. But to one who brings with them the larger sense of knowing the use of your spiritual vision to see, you begin to notice that all things that surround you are existing in various dimensions. There is the material plane and the actual existence of matter before you, and as well there is a component of spirit which indwells all, and that is the aspect that you are awakening to with your spiritual senses. Everything that happens to you, everything you come in contact with, has multiple facets to its reality. Viewing these circumstances and individuals only through the eyes of the flesh means you do not have an accurate picture of all that transpires.\nBut developing this sense of spiritual vision you are able to discern far more that is inherent in your situations than is evident on the surface. All of you have been engaged for some time in developing your spiritual sense of awareness, your spiritual vision. More and more you come to easily slide into that arena of perception, and before long they will be so intertwined that you will not be in discussion about what it is to use your spiritual eyes. You will simply be acting as you are understanding the nature and function of using this spiritual vision. For as you all know, very much that is out there in the world is not as appears, and without some deeper sense of awareness you may be misled or misguided by the simple material manifestations.\nThank you for this opportunity to join you.\n",

        "title": "Choosing, Praying and Petitioning What you Desire",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I realize that from your perspective that you are allocating that valuable time and energy towards this process and this represents the cosmic choice of your hearts to be engaged with spirit. When you have thus chosen you will be presented with opportunities to explore and utilize to further your desire for spiritual growth. The more you take, the more you ask for, the more you get.\nThe more ready you are to handle it, the more substance can come your way. You are all coming to understand that the greatest obligation and choice one can make in this life is to the furtherance of your spiritual capacity and the advancement of your spiritual character. All other jobs and distractions simply bring you away from that all important obligation. The more you benefit spiritually, the more active you become in your desire to be of service to help others as a natural result of having been helped yourself.\nAs your hearts so desire, so shall these opportunities be brought to you. Try, as time proceeds, to function in more awareness that you are in play with many facets. Look for the opportunities as they arise, the opportunity for personal growth as well as the opportunity to be of service, the opportunity for group growth. Be ever alert for these opportunities as they arise because they most certainly will arise as a result of your desires. Therefore it is you who puts in place this orchestration of events through the action of your free willed choice. It is your decision that we proceed in a given manner. It is your call that we will function in accordance with your realities. The Father intends to use you as you are, for what you are, for who you are, for where you are, as you are. He does not desire any more than you are. He would gladly take your offering of yourself and utilize it to its fullest. This is what we have to give, our choice, our desire, our efforts.\nStart the ball rolling, start the chain of events, go into movement. We are all links in the chain and it is required of us that we are the best link that we can be.\n(And later in this transmission…)\nI would make a few observations on this idea of prayer requests and asking for that which you seek. It is always proper and appropriate to ask your divine Parents for anything that your heart desires. In formulating your requests you find that you elevate your requests to more closely respond to the divine.  Even in that process have you been elevated, have you been raised up, and then having made your petition it is incumbent upon you to receive, to welcome that which is as a result of your petition.\nThere are often times when answered prayers do not appear so, they are in such stark contrast to what you had in mind when you asked that they do not at all resemble being the answer to your petition and yet they are. It is good to petition your divine Parents for anything your heart desires, but then be ready and be open to receive the answer to your prayer, most likely in a form that you do not recognize as being the one you would choose. Therefore will the alert student of spirituality be able to glean the direction and focus of the divine by the answers to their prayers.\n",

        "title": "Discerning Life's Lessons",
        "Body": "Question #4:  Even more than the Melchizedeks, we humans are sometimes left standing in the dust of our failure about what should have been spiritual understanding of our problems living life. First, would you mind providing us a discussion about what discernment is?\nQuestion #5:  And second, do you foresee the need to test we humans by setting up exercises to force us to at least engage the process of discernment? Do we gain anything by engaging the process in spite of the failure to discern?\nMonjoronson: Discernment can work in two manners. One is, before you make a decision and once afterwards. Right action, right living has more of an opportunity to be expressed when you discern a situation. In this case, you are giving forethought to what the opportunities for action are. You are weighing, sorting, sifting, examining, analyzing the various options for action and which has the best reward for your decision. When you do this ahead of time you are actually living through what you will do in the future, after you make the decision and take action. You are giving forethought to the value of each option and how it pertains to you and how it gives value to your life and to others and which is the best course of action.\nDiscernment afterwards occurs during the process of reflection. You have had an experience and it may be good or it may not be; it may be productive or unproductive, in any case you can make it into a productive situation even though it resulted in failure or a wrong outcome. Reflecting on your experience gives you wisdom. Wisdom does not come forth easily, does not reveal itself quickly, but only through the process of discernment. You obviously were presented at one time with options for action. You chose one, took action and it may have turned out wrongly. Now you must reflect upon that wrong decision and the outcome of that decision which was disappointing. You again discern the options that were available and what caused you to choose the one you did and why you did not choose the higher option, one that would result in positive outcome.\nIf you are unable to discern between the options and discern the wisdom involved in your wrong choice, then ask for assistance from your guides or guardians, from Melchizedeks, the midwayers or from Christ Michael. If you are unable to receive assistance in a clear format to yourself then ask a wise friend to assist you for clarification of the options, the one you chose and discern how it became detrimental to you. I hope this assists you. This is the major thrust of your lifetime here as a mortal on a material world, to have experiences and to sort through them.\nFor your second question, surely we do not propose or present you with these difficulties. You life on this world, Urantia, is as difficult as one could ever experience on any other planet in Nebadon. You do not need to have challenges thrown in your way to learn these lessons. Your life is already filled with many challenges and opportunities to learn great lessons and you will come away from this lifetime into the morontia realm with a tremendous repertoire of experiences to gain further wisdom from your lessons and teachings in that realm. Those that you miss here will be given to you on the other side as a morontial being who is ascending. You will be given reviews for your performance; you will be given options and lessons for examining your lifetime here in the material world. You will see many of your experiences here offer many opportunities for choices and for actions which you did not see while you were here.\nYour world truly is an opportunity for tremendous morontial growth later. Those of you who procrastinate and defer decisions will be put in 'kindergarten' so to speak to learn those lessons and to catch up with your fellow classmates. You will have much work to do. For those of you who like to live life to the experience to make decisions right or wrong, to take action, your life is one of an adventure, one of tremendous opportunities for mining great wisdom when you become a morontial being. No my friend, you do not need any further obstacles to your material lifetime here. You cause enough difficulties for yourself and your fellow travelers cause enough difficulties for yourself as well. There is no need to make your life a further difficult situation than it is.

        "Body": "Question:  The power of prayer is meaningless if it does not produce the desired effect. Even though I am a human mortal, if my desire matches the will of the Father, will my prayer be answered on behalf of the one I pray for?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. The very first step I must do is take issue with this preamble to some degree. The statement that your prayer is meaningless if it is unanswered is simply a false statement. No prayer is meaningless. Prayer is like meditation or worship in that it is a state that you enter into which always benefits, always helps. Whether or not you are able to perceive whether or not you received answer to your prayer, nevertheless the act of prayer itself was a benefit to you as the one who prayed, and I assure you, to the one you are praying for as well as the universe at large. This act of prayer is a signal to all the universe that you would align with them in actuating this circuitry of spirit and in so doing you are literally growing as a spiritual being and therefore the results are there to be witnessed by all those who have eyes to see or means to perceive in the spiritual dimension.\nI understand that as mortals of the realm you are clearly tied to a rather cause and effect existence. This happens, then that occurs, this resulted in that and if you do this, that happens, and every time this happens. And so you would naturally transfer this same desire to see such a clearly evident pattern into your spiritual pursuit and therefore you assign this act of prayer as the cause and you are desiring seeing a meaningful effect. You do not necessarily perceive the effects of the spiritual realm as you are clearly yet so material; so how can you sincerely declare that there are no effects when you may very well be quite unable to perceive what effects there may be? This is where you must exercise your faith, the faith that you know this is the process, this is how it works; it is an unseen process but not an unknown process. Go within, ask your Inner Guides, consult your Spirit of Truth and determine for yourself if you can really make such a statement as prayer is meaningless if I do not see my desired results.\nI hope this helps to bring some perspective to the two different realms which you are trying to measure with the same standard. Thank you.\n",

        "title": "Spirit, the Unrestricted Energetic Component of Yourself",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Greetings, I am Monjoronson here to pick up the thread, the string that was just laid down before you. You all have many ways of referring to spiritual energy. You may call this energy vibration or energy or energy turned into light.  You may feel presence [or] you may even feel this energy impacting your very vehicle. In fact, all things are energy. Your vehicle is energy bound together and slowed to a vibration that is stable but as well you have an unstable fluctuating part of yourselves as well and this part of you which is also energy is not bound by the same constraints as your physical vehicle which must obey the laws of material physics. Your spirit, as you refer to it is able to transcend these earthly requirements and you can recognize this even in your sleep state when you awaken and feel as though you have been traveling or feel as though you have just experienced an alternate reality.\nAt this point in your spiritual evolution you do not have a great deal of command over the actions of this spirit component. You see it as bound and linked to your physical vehicle and therefore you do not necessarily make allowance for the freedom and flexibility that this aspect of yourself truly has as part of its very nature. But more and more as you practice exercises such as stillness, prayer, worship and meditation you begin to grant more and more latitude to this aspect of yourself and allow that you may go beyond the realm of the physical sheerly by an act of your creative will, in fact an act of your permission. The more you practice these forays into the spiritual dimension the more comfortable you are with allowing that aspect of yourself the flexibility and freedom to be its creative self as you may feel it in this exercise you undertake even now.\nEach one of you is localized in your physical vehicle in the location that you call home but simultaneously by an act of your own choosing and freewill do you grant yourselves the ability to gather together your spirits to bring them to this circuitry that is formed and thereby you have transcended the limitations of your physical being in one location restricted to one experience. You have granted yourselves additional layers of experience in your willingness to gather together in a forum such as this and likewise you may learn to project yourselves out to any location that you should so desire. These episodes that we are engaged in now are training grounds for you to develop comfort zones around traveling and directing your unrestricted component of yourself.\nI have with me a devoted assistant who desires to help you with this experience and so I would step back and introduce you to a member of my staff who specializes in the building of circuits and the development of circuitry. Her name is Serena, I am sure you will welcome her.\nSerena: Hello, I am Serena and it is my desire to join you in this exercise. As Monjoronson has said, you are engaged in this process of developing a sense of circuitry, a sense of connection. As you become more and more familiar with this you will be able to reconnect and reform this circuitry in any configuration you should so choose. I am endowed with special skills which enable me to infuse circuits and circuit makers with additional energy to be provided for this purpose and I would do so now with your permission.\n(Pause in Stillness).\n…simply relax into the peace of this silence. I would encourage you all, each one to practice this ability to project yourselves out, to reach out to others, other personalities, other places. You have it well within your capacities to allow yourselves to go out and play in the great universe for this part of yourselves that you engage with is boundless and you will come to see, even timeless. Enjoy the opportunity to practice feeling yourselves in alternate locations with those other energy signatures that you can relate to. By engaging in this practice you will come to be more free with your lives and your experiences, you will not feel so restricted or bound by your circumstance of the moment. It will be possible for you to transport yourself away as it were. You may undertake these exercises with the simple act of recalling a fond location and with the use of your mind to replay the details of the environment you may find yourselves back there again and it is ever true that your thoughts have the power to create such a reality.\n",

        "title": "Energy is Pattern",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  All things are energy in different form. You are simply a collection of energy in divine pattern. You are a mass of individual energy units collected together and formed into pattern. Likewise your food is, as well, energy collected into pattern. This energy that you take in passes through you, becomes you, passes out of you, and sustains the organized energy that is you. Likewise your water is similar, energy in particular form which you take in. It passes through you, out of you, changes its nature and composition, and it is taken up by the higher energy form and is released back into the environment as waste. Your sunlight as well is an energy in a different form. It is quite necessary to the functioning of your organism of self.\nEverything that you know in this material realm is comprised of energy that has been transformed into its pattern, much of it appearing to you to be static or unchanged, but in fact those things you consider to be permanent are in fact still changing, simply at a slower rate.\nThe stone does not change at the same rate as the flower. Both are comprised of energy in a state of flux. You are learning that there are many types of energy and many manifestations that you may come into contact with and even learn to direct. Whereas you may not create sunlight, you certainly have found ways to focus it and direct it, to shield yourselves from it, to take advantage of it in your growth cycles. It is not necessary for you to understand the creation of this form of energy as much as it is you understand the use of it and how to exist with it and even how to maximize its potential, as you do when you plant your garden accordingly to take advantage of the season of the sun.\nAs you venture into the spiritual realm and contact a whole new set of energy parameters, you will learn how to exist with these universal principles, and once again you will find that it is not necessary for you to understand how these principles are created or how they are there to be used, but rather that they are there to be used, and you have a part you can play in their direction, in their use, in their focus.\nSo if you begin to see all things as energy, then it becomes easier for you to consider that as an energy yourselves, as a combination of energies, you have relationship to the various forms of energy, the various wavelengths of energy. Because you are a child of the greatest energy of all, the First Source and Center, you as well have some influence over these various energy circuits. As you practiced in your exercise today, you may take and direct these energies, you may send them out, you may focus them, you may project them as you will, as you do in your daily lives, and these energies are as real as the energy that comprises the stone.\nThat is the difficult one for mortal man to grasp, something so untouchable, unsolid, may in fact be as real and as definite as something that seems so static and permanent as stone. But they are all energy in different forms, providing different functions, adhering to different patterns. They are all real; they are all genuine. So think not that your activities in focusing spiritual energies are any less significant than your activities in focusing material energies in the work that you do, the actions that you take.\nThese are all directed energies; they are simply in different form, adhering to different pattern.\n",

        "title": "The Merkaba",
        "Body": "Question #7:  Mary: This next questioner is asking for help in figuring out the \"merkaba\" and they would like you to please discuss the \"merkaba\" as a tool for things such as spiritual growth or reaching stillness. Is there a proper way to visualize this ethereal energy system as it surrounds us? What is its proper use? What colors are involved and where? Are rotational fields involved? What is the difference in establishing a personal \"merkaba\" and a group \"merkaba\"?\nSo as you can see from the numerous questions about the details of the \"merkaba,\" this person is struggling to understand it and asking if you could help them through this. They thank you for your efforts to enlighten.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your efforts to put forth questions in an attempt to secure a greater understanding. I pick up in your line of questioning that there is a great concern for what is proper and what is right to be done when in the process of utilizing energy fields you are referring to as the merkaba and I also pick up on this concept of struggling with the process. I would like to turn both of those thought frames around because such an application of utilizing energy fields should not be a struggle and should not be confined by the inherent belief that there are strictly proper ways and improper ways to utilize and employ this energy structure of a merkaba.\nWhat this energy field is, is very simple, very basic and very easy. It is not complicated, it is not difficult and it is very difficult to do it wrong; that is there is hardly an improper use of such an attempt to utilize energy fields such as this. This whole concept refers to the idea of simply and easily bringing your intention into the process of stringing together your energy in conjunction with the energy of others in a continuous route or circuit or loop or field and in so doing you are able to generate the benefit of many times the individual values of the individual contributors to this circuit.\nThat is, as one single light bulb, you are not all that brilliant and your luminosity only carries so far. The more lights you install on your string of lights the more luminosity you all enjoy by virtue of being strung together and bound together in this single circuit. If you string enough little generators of light together they provide enough illumination that they outshine and out-power single sources which are greater in potential but are but a single filament and are only of one direction and focus. Many lights strung on a string may wind their way around in a number of directions and provide light in all different directions. They may light up a far greater area than any single light source and yet it is nothing more that a combination of little individual bulbs all focusing and concentrating their energy to act together as one. This is the concept in a nutshell.\nYou may do this at any time singly as your own individual light or you may form one of these circuits, these merkabas by simply plugging in and installing others who are also generators in this process. Every individual on this world is a generator of their own energy field. Every individual has their own energy signature and their own luminescence. When you think of another individual and their image comes to mind for you, there is also an energy signature behind their recollection. This energy signature is what you would install in your string of lights to make your circuitry of a merkaba.\nThey need not be physically present because these energy signatures are of a spiritual nature and are not bound by time nor space. They need not be aware in the moment that you are using them and their energy to further your circuitry. You may call on celestial personalities or mortal personalities to fill in your string of energy and in so doing you assemble all of these energy fields into one large energy field. It is exceedingly helpful if these contributors to the merkaba are all willing contributors and in awareness of this process but it not strictly required that they be so.\nYou may choose to put the energy of your mother in your string of energy and she need not be aware in the moment that you choose to do this but you have a certain connection with her and know that she would approve of joining you in such an endeavor and therefore here addition to your circuit is quite acceptable and accommodating. You may utilize friends, relatives, celestial personalities by invitation or by simple installation on your behalf and in so doing you create these living energy circuits which maintain their own energy signatures even in the absence of participants as they may come and go in and out of this field; that is all these little generators in this string of lights may choose to come and go and yet there is still this presence of illumination provided by the combination of the whole.\nThis combination now exists and has its own energy signature and may be drawn on by any of the participants to provide strength and comfort and assurance and power. When you have a well disciplined group of individuals engaged in this process you have a well oiled machine which may be put to work for many purposes with greater effect and significance. I hope this description has filled in a few blanks for you.\nOverall, it is my desire that you not be overburdened by the concept of proper and improper methods for experimenting with what is a creative and experiential process; rather I encourage you to experiment and try and combine different combinations and see for yourself the relative effectiveness of your efforts without the concern that you could fail the course or somehow lose the struggle. Thank you.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I am Monjoronson and it has been my pleasure to participate with many of you throughout this process of developing this format for discussion of this most critical connection between the mortal and the divine. It is my mission, it is my mandate that I oversee the instruction to this world of the connections that we enjoy, the personal connections on so many levels.\nWe are exploring in these discussions the many levels of circuitry that we are identifying and attempting to access, in fact we are building them in this very moment. Each one out there is a contributor, is a generator of energy, is a light. And while each bulb on a strand of Christmas lights by itself is not very large and does not have much impact, when you join together as in this moment, you become the strings of light together which wrap the tree, which define the perimeters, which illuminate the object and together your combined light is enough to shine out brightly.\nWe will be working as time goes by with the many approaches to energy manipulation. We have spoken previously of manipulating energy in the form of a light anchor, we have spoken about creating energy fields such as the merkaba, we have even talked of living energy systems. Each one of these is but a focus of using the same energy from on high, a different way of tapping in on that energy and focusing it.\nEach one of you likewise has an energy field and an energy focus. It is likewise possible for you to discover ways in which you might refocus your energy frequencies and as a result your realities may shift. You are in fact powerful creative beings just now awakening to that fact. Once you have discovered your inherent capacities you will truly embrace the role you have in all that you experience as your reality.\nThe time is approaching when many will be awakened to who they are in this regard, to what their inherent capacities might be and many like yourselves will elect to take more control over just what your reality will be. I tell you the days before us will be the days of miracles and wonders as you learn how to manifest the true creator attributes that you possess. In fact that is why you were created, to be a creator and to choose, elect, participate, create all that goes on around you and yet still so many in this life see themselves as victims or helpless.\nStay focused, stay present in the moment. Make your choices consciously with awareness and you will observe the truth of what I portray to you here. Many of you sense a great change in the air and you are right. This is a time of great change, of great choice, of great opportunity before us. We must choose wisely, we must select our highest ideals, our greatest visions. We must choose those and manifest those and in a very short time you will begin to see that your choices, individually and collectively will have such impact as to create the very realities you choose.\nWhat a joy it is to work with devoted individuals such as yourselves who are committed to this process of understanding and exploring who you are, what your connection to all this is. You are the ones who are seeking and you will be the ones who shall find so it is a great joy to be a part of that process and facilitate this unfolding of the plan.\n",

        "title": "Experiencing Cosmic Consciousness",
        "Body": "Preamble: Mary: The next questioner once had an experience where their mind made contact with what seemed to be a steam of thoughts and in that brief instance, all answers to everything seemed to flow inside their mind all at once.\nQuestion #2:  Was this contact with the cosmic mind?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. As you explore your spiritual dimension further and further you run into different frequencies, different channels if you will, different spaces and when you experience this shift it is quite an encounter with the shifting of dimensions that you are capable of as a being. Most of the time this shifting is very subtle or misunderstood but from time to time there are radical experiences which provide a rather jarring sense of having shifted gears and been transformed from one reality into another.\nThis phenomenon you heard of can actually be achieved in a number of ways because there are a number of circuits, a number of pathways, of routes that you could take to achieve this sense of connection. Your \"cosmic consciousness\" is not a bad phrase, neither is collective conscience or the mind circuit or the Adjuster circuit or the direct circuit that each individual has with their own inner Indwelling Fragment from the Father. Any number of these methods or modes or avenues may be used to get to this place of oneness and awareness and all of these places are connected as the assumption of oneness would declare and so in accessing any one of them you are in access to all of them. You may use any number of routes to arrive at this place and receive this flush of connection.\nTruly that is what it is, just being firmly plugged in and connected, and when you are there is this great exchange of everything and it is a profound experience and remains a profound experience even with quite a bit of exposure to it. But on this world it is a rather rare occurrence and so it is even more profound for the individual. But trust that this is a friendly universe and that you are receiving what it is you need from the universe, from your Divine Parents who are constantly ministering to you and accept what life would bring you in support of your life experience and your individual journey. Welcome these aha moments for the pinnacle that they represent, points of achievement that you can stand on for future reference for all of your days.\nThank you for this question.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I will once again return to our analogy of having worked together to form this splendid climbing team that we have assembled throughout this process together.\nI would point out to you that we have been engaged in the process of collecting our tools and assembling that which we need to help us make a successful and safe ascension of the opportunities and challenges before us. These tools that we have discussed that you have been engaged in developing for quite some time now are now in fact yours to own, each one, as part of your own personal climbing gear. You have developed these principles and techniques, and while you may not have had as of yet in depth experience with each and every tool, you do possess these tools to have and to use at your command.\nLikewise in our journey together you have witnessed how it feels when one of your group stumbles and misses their footing, perhaps even falls. You have faithfully and dutifully rallied in support of those who have mis-stepped, and you have held firm to your lines, and you have adhered to your techniques, and your party has ascended as a group. Now we find ourselves not at our lower base camp but huddled at higher elevations having enjoyed the accomplishments of our efforts so far and our successes to date. In this process the experience throughout you have each developed a greater experiential sense of what it is we are doing and the process with which we are doing it, and you are coming into awareness that you do in fact possess that which you need to serve you in this regard.\nAs we join together in this hour I will continue this imagery in response to your sincere desires to know where we are going and what is up for us as we look to our future.\nMy dear ones, there is a storm brewing, and it most certainly will be upon us in the near future, and at this time we will not see our situation look the same as it has, although it will be the same in many ways. Rather than making this ascent and having individual\nmembers falter in their step by step processes, our next challenge will be how we react when we are under siege by a storm which overtakes us, and we must collectively rally and use our tools to find our way through when the wind drives and the way becomes murky and clouded with the blowing turmoil of snow around us, of life around us.\nI tell you that there is a storm approaching. It will come upon us; it will overtake us; it will seem intense and blinding. It will appear threatening and dangerous. It will trigger you to question your abilities and the tools you have at hand at your disposal. This will provide you yet with another opportunity for building your faith and strengthening your character. I assure you you have everything you need with you; you are supplied sufficiently. You have been trained to encounter and to endure such adversity as will arise and even more.\nYou have been trained to conquer this adversity by creating your own reality within the storm. No matter that the winds might howl; no matter that the darkness may overtake us prematurely and we may have to employ our skills at understanding to navigate safely through. We have been trained. We have been supplied.\nWe simply lack the experience of the assurance that all will be well. This conviction I offer as your guide; this assurance I bring as I am well aware that you are well equipped and well provided for. You are, in fact, quite safe even in the midst of darkness and turmoil, and you know this in your minds.\nYou will soon have an opportunity to practice this in your reality, and I can assure you that all will be well when such a storm most certainly blows by and ... a changed landscape, but your compass reading, your internal guide, your moral compass reading, remain constant and although your trail may be obscured by the shift of reality, your direction may remain certain by virtue of your internal compass reading.\nAgain, all will most certainly be well, in fact, there are few things sweeter than the dawn after the storm has passed. Then is when you appreciate what you have done and where you are and the deepening of your experience in having gotten there. I will be with you throughout this process, available to you as your guide. But you, each one, are making this journey with me, are becoming guides yourselves and having gained this experience together you will be qualified to lead your own search parties searching for truth, beauty, and goodness. Lead them up your own individual ascension paths.\nThis is what you are in training to do and to be, to lead the others who will come after you up these trails and to navigate these obstacles. Make no mistakes that once we have done this, once it is yours as a matter of experience, it becomes yours to teach and to show as well. That is your privilege and your opportunity, and it is my privilege and my opportunity to lead you up this time, to show you the way, to illustrate the techniques and the approaches so that you may embrace them as yours and in so doing portray these patterns and techniques to all those who will come after you and seek your guidance so that they will know that you have been to the mountain top and you have seen the other side.\nThey will desire to follow you up and have you show them, This will be your privilege as it is mine even now. Do not fear, my little ones, you are well taken care of, and you are not nearly so little as you think you are, for having dedicated yourselves to this process you have grown immensely in this path. You have the commitment of your Creator to share this journey with you, and that is another gift and accomplishment that you will be privileged enough to share with those who would seek what you have found.\nTherefore is your mission protected and safe. You are gaining that experience and undertaking those challenges that they may be part of your resume as a spiritual ambassador. I hope to convey a sense of peace no matter what storm might be on the horizon. No matter what may arise in life to muddy the waters or cloud your environment you know who you are; you know you have your Creator with you. You know you are lovingly guided and tended to, and you know your survival is assured. Therefore simply accept what all this life experience brings you, knowing the outcome of your spiritual survival is a certainty.\nThank you for accepting our partnership and my role in this process that allows me to be here with you at this hour. I cherish this opportunity to come close to you in this fashion, and I welcome any future opportunities that arise for us to be together in this way and meet anytime, anywhere you will create the environment to do so.\n",

It is simply awareness and each of you were at one time as well, unaware of greater spiritual truths and principles.  So …You can surely identify with your brothers and sisters who are at this place of unawareness still and could use your loving assistance to bring them to a higher place of awareness. But this is almost never accomplished by force. You do not argue someone into a higher place of awareness.\nYou do not debate someone and challenge someone to elevate their awareness for the more you challenge, debate and use force in the equation the more the individual you are engaged with will dig in and debate back and challenge again. It is using the sword and shield approach, when you draw yours and come forward in assurance, certainly they will draw theirs as a matter of instinct. So I implore you in all manners as you move forward, since you ask for a posture to maintain throughout, that you maintain a posture of peace keeper, that you enter into your relations with your sisters and brothers unarmed. Put down your sword and shield and your desire to be right and to prove yourself and go into these encounters as an example of love and tolerance and peace and grace.\nYour entering into the fray so unarmed and so at peace will in and of itself, defray the defensive manner of your partner in any relationship. I was almost to use the term, opponent, but that is an incorrect term as you are not opposed, you are simply divergent and in the end, your amount of divergence is rather insignificant as compared with your amount of convergence. You are all brothers and sisters, you all have many things in common and your differences are small compared with your similarities and this great truth that you desire to spread is most successfully spread from a posture of peace and love, acceptance and faith.\nYou do not need to do battle with anyone out there when you stand in your own truth. You can be the eye in the storm, the eye of calm, the eye of peace for you know the truth, you know higher ways and so you need not be sucked into the storm around you unless it is your choice that you divert your energies thus and then surely the storm around you can suck you in and you may suffer some of the consequences of your choice to be sucked into the storm. I advise you to limit your exposure to the storm. It is not necessary for you to keep abreast of the magnitude hourly of how fierce the storm rages around you for you know there is a storm, you know that it rages.\nIs it all that important to know the depth and the horrors and the details involved or does that knock you off balance, get you out of the eye of the storm and into the storm itself. I encourage you to see yourself as the eye of the storm and to let it swirl around you but not to be swept up in it and when you do find yourselves in the material course of life, confronted with having to engage with the details and material aspects of your life, do that from the same position of the eye of the storm, unarmed and in peace, not prepared to do battle to get your way, not desiring to overcome any opponent with your correctness but merely be the example of the calm eye of the storm; the unarmed participant, the one who is not desirous to be engaged in conflict but is more desirous of being engaged in loving association.\nThese postures if adopted will change your life. You will not be buffeted about and you will be a great source of calm and peace to those around you.\nAt times this may be a very difficult choice for you to make because the storm may rattle your windows and grow very close and you may be concerned even for your own safety but still, the best way to navigate through such a storm is to remain fixed in the eye, that is the ultimate eye, the you, the I Am presence. You are connected to the ultimate calm, peace and love and you can reside there if you so choose.\nI observe also in your conversation that there is much out there in the news, in the world, much happening with your brothers and sisters that is cause for distress when seen from such a narrow perspective as you each have. Once again I must assure you that even though there exists all of these things that you say and more, they are all known [to] the First Source and Center and to Michael. If so much more is known, including how all of these aspects are necessary to the stages of growth and awareness [then] they can be seen as the needed facilitators of growth and not so much as the evil out workings of man.\nYou know even in your lives, in your own experiences, that all things are made to be used to the positive effect of the Father's plan for you. And so it is with all these episodes you witness even today, there is purpose, there will be purpose and significance in all that transpires and again you may help affect this purpose with the infusion of spirit content into all that you are exposed to. As I witnessed here today, there were negative examples given and then positive examples provided as well. There needs to be this balance and you are the ones most capable of the reassuring tones of the love of your Divine Parents.\nWhen those around you are troubled it will be your privilege and your pleasure to speak these words of comfort and peace and love to those who are in your presence. In this way you literally alter the equation, change the balance and this is our pleasure and privilege to do at this time. What greater privilege could be granted than to simply be the messengers of the love and peace and beauty of the creators of all this love and peace and beauty.\nSo let us be about this task with joy, no matter what we may encounter along the route and how close the storm may be to our dwelling.\nMay we still be bold in proclaiming this love and grace and peace, even so much so that we may embody these qualities and manifest these ideals. I would contain my remarks to these and again offer my gratitude for your willing acceptance of me into your arena. I now withdraw and would remain if there were any questions.\nQuestion:.... There is a Chinese saying that says to be informed and not act is to be not informed. If I recount Michael's experience in Palestine, He undoubtedly was informed about everything that was going on around him. If we look at the parable of the good samaritan, if I were informed of a brother who was beset by brigands and not act, would I not be just as guilty as the two who passed him by? What degree of information becomes a detriment, at what point do we get sucked into the storm?\nMonjoronson: I would refer back to some of the comments I heard in your discussion prior and borrow from them in that your information indeed be a useful tool to you until the point that you become unduly influenced or debilitated by its presence. This also speaks to becoming depressed, feeling guilty, feeling that you are not doing what you could, simply because you know of its awareness. All of these feeling are stifling to the process of spiritual growth. If you feel guilty that you did not come forward and offer service to another then you are taking what could have been a positive and growth-full learning experience and turning it upon yourself as a negative obstacle to be overcome.\nSo to the point that growing your awareness inspires you and motivates you or brings you greater peace through your awareness then this is all good, but I caution you that your society is overburdened with information. Does it really positively impact you to know the cases around you of deviant behavior by your brothers and sisters for example. Is this promoting of your spiritual peace and awareness or does being bombarded with information knock you away from this peace and bring you a feeling of desperation or great concern because if this is the case, then the information has not proved helpful to you, it has only brought you fear, depression and anxiety.\nNone of these are supportive of a state of good spiritual health. When you see any of these factors encroach into your life, that is your indicator that too much is too much. To the degree that you can be inspired and elevated and motivated to be all that you can be, to be of service, to act out your desires, to pursue truth, beauty and goodness, then information is a good and powerful tool. To the degree that it detracts from those objectives, it turns and becomes an obstacle, a problem an issue. It does not serve the kingdom if your become overburdened to the point of becoming ill or to the point of becoming paralyzed.\nSurely as a citizen you bear some requirement to be informed and to know the basics but you are not required to overburden yourself at any time with struggles that are involved in much of the details. If you take on these struggles they will knock you off balance. So I encourage you to strike a balance that is appropriate for you with always a primary consideration to your internal spiritual health and climate. If you bring too much of this storm into this climate you will have no safe haven, no safe place to retreat, no eye in the storm.\nRemember, the storm either is or is not, but it is outside of you, it is out there. You are not required to bring it in. Your internal climate should be peaceful and calm and entirely filled with things to nurture your spiritual peace. Try to keep your spiritual parlor within free from undue influence from the outside. Yes, the windows may rattle, the shutters may flap but you are not required to make your interior climate stormy at any time. It is a choice you make and if you truly knew the value of maintaining this internal climate you would at all cost keep it free from contamination with the elements of the storm so when you go there it is a safe haven, a place you can always be that is safe and calm.\nBut if you are a citizen you must act out there among the other citizens and you must make choices and so therefore in order to make choices you must be informed to some degree, this is your responsibility as a citizen. But in every choice, in every decision you may borrow from this safe place and bring from this safe haven this ideal of calm and peace and your higher perspectives and infuse these characteristics into your decision making process and as such you become an example of one who not only is informed but brings wisdom to the information and makes choices accordingly.\nI hope my attempts to make this distinction [are] helpful.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  With so much guidance and so many volunteers to help in this process you should rest assured that you are in good hands and well cared for in this process. I have made reference a number of times to our group being likened to a climbing party and the ascent we have before us, and we have been enjoying a restful time at our camp while we bask in the grace and the glow of all the guidance and all the love that is directed at us in this process.\nWe should drink of these cups of peace and love and tender guidance. They will sustain us as we press forward with the next leg of our ascension. The magnitude of difficulty of the climb before us will increase, and we will be ... to the test to remember the tools that we have been given and guidance that we have been offered and to take those gifts and make them our own in this process and use the tools combined with the skills and the training to make the best ascent possible.\nCertainly it will be challenging, but any good climber welcomes a challenge to test his skills and abilities. So it is that we rest now. Enjoy the relative calm and tranquility of our fellowship in these moments, and await the call to don our gear and head out, being truly grateful for all that we have accomplished to this point, and the rest of assurance we have had in this time before the next ascent. As the others have assured you, we will be together throughout, even though your individual ascent must be made by your own efforts, using your own skills with your own tools. Nevertheless the guides will be there to remind you of your tools and of the training you have had in their use and how best to apply both skills and tools. That's the beauty of the climbing party that we have assembled together. No one need go the journey alone. So I encourage you to rest well. Gather your strength. Assess your individual backpacks one more time and perhaps decide some of the items that you carry are burdensome to our journey and unnecessary. Release all that does not serve you in these times ahead. It is only baggage at some point and unnecessary for you to bring to the summit.\nChoose to leave some of your baggage at camp. Then, after making your ascent ask, decide whether you need what you have discard or whether you are better off without it. Take an honest ... look at that which you desire to take with you. Is it useful, serviceable, or is it cumbersome and an extra burden to carry with you any further? It is always good to look over your gear and make sure that everything is appropriate and has a purpose, is useful, even necessary. If not, then lighten your load. Your journey will be made easier.\nThere is nothing that, if it is not useful it is worth carrying with you to the summit, as you will surely wish you were unburdened as the climbing gets tough. I thank you, my friends, for your diligent attention to these lessons and even your material application to their implications. All this training, all this guidance, is for the grand purpose that will soon unfold before you. ...all these pieces of the puzzle, all these tools you have gathered will become serviceable....\nThis is all I will share today. I will take my leave, but along with the others offer my commitment to be with you throughout. Thank you.\n",

        "title": "Stillness, A Way of Positioning Yourself in the Storm",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Greetings, I am Monjoronson here to be with you, to share with you, to simply be with you in whatever state we may find ourselves in the moment.\n…If I can paint a picture in your mind's eye, consider yourself in a small vessel out in the open waters. When there are no waves to buffet you about you may be at ease about your vessel and its position and your position relative to the vessel's. You may lean over the edge; you may stand up and walk about; you may enjoy the smell of calm seas that permit you the freedom to explore the perimeters of your vessel with no fear or danger associated with these activities.\nThen consider the event in which the storm rises and the seas swell and the wind blows and there are waves now to navigate. You no longer feel as though you are as comfortable with your vessel, and you find yourself retreating to the very center of your vessel so that you may safely ride out the storm. As well, wisdom would dictate to you that you orient your vessel to meet head-on the swells and to take the waves with the best positioning of your craft. This activity of positioning yourself relative to the storm is likened to your practice and discipline of stillness.\nThe wisdom derived from your discipline at stillness tells you how best to weather the storm, to furl your sails and point your vessel into the wind. The act of finding your safe place in the center of your vessel is, as was just described to you, retreating to your inner sanctum, to your place of peace and stability, the safest place you may find yourself in any storm. Having done these things you are then well equipped to ride out the temporary event that is at hand. And you are then graced with the experience; you are then gaining the wisdom of having mastered the circumstance and having prevailed through the times of challenge. You have had the training. You have been told of the laws of nature regarding these transient episodes. You have been prepared for these events ahead. It is now simply that you follow through with your training, that you rely on your wisdom, and that you always remember the safe posture to maintain as you are buffeted about in life.\nYou may take a beating; you may get wet; you may be tossed about, but you will hold fast to the rudder and keep your heading and maintain your safe position in the center of all. Doing so you will most certainly make it through as the storm passes and the waters calm again. You cannot be reminded enough that you are lovingly attended to; you are never forsaken in your process, in your journey. Always does the love of your parents surround you, nurture you, and provide you with that necessary for your ultimate survival. But as many times as you are reminded of this fact, there is a tendency when living this material manifestation to return to fear, to allow doubt and uncertainty to be brought on board with you.\nThese are your challenges as great as any storm that arises. But when you begin to doubt your training and second guess your abilities and skills then is when you may be caught broadside and have your vessel in peril. You as sailors in the spiritual realm should now be aware that even such a vessel as you now navigate is only part of your journey, and that even if such a vessel is lost, the journey is not. Recall this when those around you founder and are lost. They are only lost to you, to your sight.\nThey are never lost to your divine Parents who continue their loving watch care no matter what transpires. The seas will swell; the storm will thunder; many a good sailor will be overtaken. Yet all of this is but the blink of an eye on your eternal journey where you switch vessels many times and navigate many seas and sail through many storms. The vessel may change; the storms will be different, but you are enduring. You will survive. So fear not as you brave your individual journey, for there is nothing that can happen that is not a part of the bigger journey. Truly you have been told and you are growing to know the truth of the statement that all is well in the bigger picture. It may not appear that way at any small snapshot of your journey, but truly it is so that all is part of the gigantic divine plan and therefore all is well. Thank you, my dear ones, for sharing your journeys with us that we may counsel you and share your experience, as you are the ones with your hands on the rudders. You are the ones who will decide which course is taken, and a universe is along for the ride.\nFarewell.\n",

        "title": "Be at Peace with the Process",
        "Body": "Preamble: This questioner says they are really learning lots of new things and that they feel that they still haven't digested the new things they are learning. They say it feels like fiction even though they know it's reality. They tried to meditate the other day using a guided video on You Tube but during the process their heart started racing really bad and it felt like it was beginning to explode!\nQuestion:  I really want to be able to focus and try and meet my higher guide in meditation without feeling scared of what I might see or feel. Please, can you help or tell me what it is I am doing wrong?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. I think this question represents the questions of a great many mortals on this world. The very first thing I must do is to take issue with your observation that you are doing something wrong. If you are attempting to further your spiritual progress, it is not possible to do something wrong. There are however, routes that are more and less effective based upon your individual perception and needs and persuasion.\nFirst and foremost, the practice of meditation or stillness as it has been referred to, is the practice of shutting down all extraneous stimulation and allowing the natural process to occur. Built in to your experience is this natural process of coming to a state of spirit. It is not heralded by sounds or any particular landmark to let you know that you have arrived. What you are attempting to do is to simply create the space, as it were, for you to be in this state of spirit.\nNow, as for your concern as to being afraid of what you might find there, I will tell you that what you will find there has been with you since your earliest memories. What you will find there is that instant thought that crosses your mind, that “aha” inspiration, that sense of profound peace, that sense of being connected to all that is, relating to that part of yourself which is connected to all that is and looking at those fleeting thoughts that you have in a different way. So all the while you are trying to simply trying to quiet the material aspect of yourself to allow the spiritual aspect, which is quite subtle, a space to be in.\nThis is both an active process and at once a passive letting go and drifting into this space. There is no fear in this space, there is no concern for who you might meet. This is a space where you are certain the universe is a friendly place and that you are a member of a gigantic enterprise who are loved, and known, and cared for. If you find that you're mind will not flow as you attempt to slow down your material aspects, then perhaps, direct the mind to be in service to the project at hand and focus the intention of the mind on a worthy pursuit; one of prayer, one of worship, one of deep contemplation, one of profound gratitude.\nIf you direct the mind to occupy itself with any of these undertakings, then it too is working for the common purpose. But there is a great tendency when the mind is working, for it to become the center of all focus and energy. The idea is for the center you are in, not to be the mind and not to be the body. It is something in between, it is that soul, that aspect of yourself which is neither mind nor body but yet a combination of all. The ultimate answer to your question, is of course as you know internally, and that is that practice, of course, makes perfect in this regard and in all other regards. If it is your desire to become proficient at mastering this internal domain, then efforts must be extended, practice must be undertaken and there are always rewards for such practice.\nSo I encourage you to pursue your desire with a determined attitude and you will most certainly see the rewards for your efforts. Be at peace with the process. Allow it to be. It should not contain the elements of struggle but perhaps the elements of surrender.\nI wish you well in your pursuit. Thank you.\n",

The tatters of the ravages of the Lucifer Rebellion, are being knitted up, are being mended and sewn together. Once more will the whole cloth of beauty and peace, overshadow and enwrap this planet. You each are a part of this repair.\nThere has been much damage done, and yet not so much that it cannot be repaired. For this I have come, and will one day, stand before you as your friend, as your companion and your helper, in your desire to be of service. In the interim time, be not dismayed by your seeming inability to get your \"wheels\" going. The Correcting Time is a correcting time for all, even those and maybe even especially those, who wish to be of this greater service. Allow yourself to be instructed and informed in your inmost heart, in your times of quietude with the Father, instructed as to the correcting of your own beings, your own motivations and directions.\nI would say to relax, children. Be not anxious; relax into your present moment, and remain at one with your higher self. Allow this higher self to work through you; remember to build the bridge and maintain the bridge in each day, in each moment. See the bridge in whatever way is useful for you.\nConstruct, build, maintain and use this bridge; it is a gift given freely to you, this advice. It will serve you well. I and my entourage, my cadre of helpers and assistants are working steadily in this realm. We are, and I am available for these types of visitations when you are willing. Prepare yourselves for a year of guidance and goodness and peace. Maintain your optimism, for optimism in the present moment creates goodness in the future. The time of darkness is waning; believe it, children! It is waning; the new dawn is breaking. I am Monjoronson. I bid you a good day and peace in your hearts today. Carry this peace with you; allow it not to be shattered by thoughts of lack or failure. More—much more—will be revealed to you.\nI leave my peace with you; please pass it on, and good day.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  There are many myriad ways to express and experience the light and the love of God’s creation. There is no limit to what you can put your imagination to.  [By] joining your thoughts with others to create something new and different or to create together a circuit that can be used for the benefit of others, you have only to apply your desires, your sincere intent, and enlist the help of celestials and your unseen friends. We are all here to aid you in any process which you deem desirable and beneficial for the Correcting Time.\nMy mission is to encourage and augment all human efforts which are already under way, to see that what you have already begun is built upon and grows incrementally each time you take it upon yourselves to practice and use effective techniques for energy construction and transmission.\nYou are beginning to understand and enter into a truly creative process which is not just being handed to you with an instruction sheet.  You are in a very real sense the co-creators of it.  We wish to emphasize this sot you eventually see what we see in you… your great potential.   When Michael was on this planet, he told his brethren they would do things far greater than even he would accomplish when in the flesh. Those were not hollow words.\nYou are only now beginning to step into the arena of understanding those words.  Beyond the mindal understanding, you are beginning to understand the experience in your bodies…the reality of this truth. You are beings far greater than your physical body.  You are light and energy and love.  You are the containers, the conduits of these realities…tarnished conduits as of yet, it is true.\nYou are receiving all of the help we can possibly pour into this effort…more than you are aware of at this time.  As the tarnish is worn away and you become shinier conduits, you will realize more and more.  You will see less dimly.  You will understand greater and higher truths than you are even able to imagine now.\nSo use your imagination, my friends. Go with your imaginations.  The truth is even beyond that.  The realities that you will come into and grow into even in your physical lifetimes are beyond what you can fathom now.  If you have the desire and courage, you can step into far grander arenas than the one you dwell in now.\nWe see how thankful, how willing, and with what great love you come into these circles to receive teachings, to receive our presence.  It is so great to see you turning to the light, receiving it and working so diligently to grow.  We applaud your efforts and encourage you to continue.\nPerhaps you  have perceived that taking one step forward becomes easier each time and seems to be a larger step each time, so that your growth is quite amazing when you look back on where you were just a short time age.  Allow yourselves to do this from time to time so that you do not become discouraged and feel that our growth is too slow or that are falling behind others.  Each of you is exactly where you need to be at exactly the right time.  Remember that every moment counts.  That divine now is all that ever is.  It is all that anyone ever has to work with at that exact moment.\nSo be balanced in your thinking.  Be not judgmental or critical or yourselves beyond the point of reflection of how you have grown and changed.  Self criticism is beneficial only if it propels you forward to learn more and grow more. That process, my friends continues on into eternity.  When you look towards eternity let it remind you that there is no one who is behind or ahead.  We are all here to help one another.  I would remind you of all the unseen help that you have within you, your thought adjuster, and around you: Mother and Michael, myself, the angels, midwayers and many others. You can call on any of us at any moment and receive our help.  It is always available but will not be thrust upon you without your asking.\nRemember to open yourselves.  [Be openly willing to] ask for what you need at that moment.  It will  be instantly there.  Then live in thankfulness and joy for all that our Creator bestows.  It is infinite goodness.  What lies before us is part of God’s grand design.  I am no greater or lesser than any of you participants in this correcting time.  We are all here to work together, to work toward this lofty and attainable goal of Light and Life.  It is my pleasure to convey [these] words tonight.  Now let us spend a few moments simply being in one another’s presence\n[Long Pause]\nAmen. My Friends, be of Good Cheer.\n",

        "Body": "Question:  Short of having God's business card with the laws written on them, how can I be reminded that when I am operating using one of those laws, how they operate even when I am under stress?\nMonjoronson: The universal laws do not come with a manual at your level of existence and experience, for you learn these laws through experience. You apply the wisdoms of the ages that you have heard through the various wise books that you have read and the teachers who have taught you. You learn to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. You would learn that the universe is good, always has been and always will be good and that it is generous and beneficent, it is all wholly and good for you and everyone. This is a grand school where you learn the experience of growth and you learn how to grow. You open yourself to God's presence.\nThe laws are all around you but few see them, few read the signs and omens of growth, few understand the oneness that is required to flow easily with this goodness of the universe. Truly the philosophies of the Taoists are good. This is the emulation of the oneness, the flow of good in the universe. The laws of the universe are learned slowly. They are immutable, unchangeable. They persist through your earthly life through the morontial and spiritual and exist as a way of life in the eternal. You can learn these more quickly when you ask to be taught these lessons. Do not be surprised if you do not see a placard or a postcard in the mail with them written out but that you will be presented with lessons of life and given reviews so that you understand those laws.\n",

        "title": "The Great Lesson to Learn",
        "Body": "Question:  What is the most basic, foundational change to life on Urantia that must be put into place for the Correcting Time to be successful? Is achieving right-mindedness where it should start? Or is it something even more basic than that?\nMonjoronson: As regards the individual’s right-mindedness, it’s a proper way of looking at what will assist the world. But this planet in particular has a great lesson to learn as of yet, and that is the ability to live in harmony with one another. This entails learning to address differences of viewpoint with care and compassion for one another in a sincere desire to bring the greatest good for all. Human beings are wired to have a broad range of viewpoints, for that stimulates the growth of each one. But your world currently engages all too often in forcing the orientation of one perspective upon others or excluding others from that orientation.\nThere will come a time when, and I say figuratively speaking, the skies will open and you will be introduced to your cosmic brothers and sisters from afar or from a dimension above. The time now is to learn to cooperate with yourselves; it’s a basic lesson; it’s a kindergarten level of social behavior. Then you will be prepared for the embrace of your higher brothers and sisters. You will not be visited until you learn this lesson, for we wish to spare you the embarrassment for not having come prepared. So I am here and hosts of ministering spirits dwell upon your world to take your hand and show you the way. If you take our hands, that is rightmindedness. As you step, that is also that same willingness; when you step we go forward.\nI appreciate your interest in my answers to your questions. I am ever thankful for your being so willing to address me. I can only offer you words designed to assist you. But the true work is in your lap, and that is for you to derive the insight and the comprehension you can as these responses are integrated into your personal lives and your personal comprehension.\n",

        "title": "Testing for Truth",
        "Body": "Question:  Mary: The Bible teaches that we should test the spirits: \"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world\" [1 John 4:1] but it does not teach how to do the test. Would you please teach us how? Though we do not know how to test the spirit, if we could for evaluating the T/R communication quality, would you mind accepting to pass our test? Thank you very much Monjoronson.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for the question. There has been discussion at some length about the different ways of knowing the truth. You have two avenues available to you which provide means whereby you may directly assess the truth relative to your being. Michael has bestowed upon you the Spirit of Truth and you may at any point, at every point, petition this spirit, petition Michael to furnish this spirit in your time of quest and then provide a space to receive the answer that you seek. Michael has graced you with this gift because He desires that you have a safety check to use at your will and command to verify for you the accuracy of any truth by going within and asking for help from Michael, from His Spirit of Truth and then positioning yourself to allow for the grace of His response. You may be assured you will receive a response but there must be this space created and provided, there must be this alignment with this process in order to access this process.\nAdditional to this, you each and every one have a Divine Fragment of the First Source and Center, a red line, if you will, directly to the First Source and Center who most certainly can provide verification of the authenticity of any truth you are in question about. Oftentimes this happens regularly with you. It is your first initial feeling, it is that little voice inside, it is the reflection when you feel that flush of conviction and certainty. Those are times when your Indwelling Guide, your Thought Adjuster, your Voice Within is acting to provide you with the very assurance that you seek. You may as well develop a relationship which is more profound with this aspect of yourself and as well you must create this space and align yourself for this process to be more discernible by you.\nBoth of these processes are done within. All the answers you seek are found there within. You have been provided with all that is needed to not only establish the accuracy and authenticity of the relative truths you are exposed to, but you may utilize these inner processes to actually find truth that you seek. All this is available with your dedication and your intention to be about this process. I would say that it is true: You should not take on face value anything you are told or hear or are exposed to on the outside without running it through these internal filters, but then you must trust that you have within you these internal filters or else you have no where to go to verify truth or to establish its authenticity.\nIf you do grow to trust these inner means by which you may contact truth, then this system of discovering truth may be made much easier for you simply pass all that you are exposed to through these filters and accept that they will be identified for what they are. Many times you will discover that there are indeed truths contained within material you are exposed to and you may tease out these truths without having to reject everything or considering that it must be all or nothing at all. These filters you have within are able to discern and pick out the truth which is pertinent and relevant to you to be assembled into your construct of understanding.\nSo utilize these gifts of grace that you have within. That is the only true measure of truth to any individual. All other information that you have is subject to interpretation by the mind that is easily deceived or confused. These internal filters are always pure and of high caliber. I hope this helps to illuminate this process of passing truth through your inner self and coming to some grips as to accepting what your Divine Gift inside tell you is truth or not. I most certainly encourage you to put my words to the test as you should all words and I will certainly honor the results of you having passed my words through your internal filters. Be at peace with the process and know that you have been given the tools necessary to define for yourself what the truth is for you in this time and then trust that this is so.\nThank you and farewell.\n",

        "title": "Corroborating the Urantia Book; Any Text is a Snapshot in Time & Space",
        "Body": "In the Urantia Book Paper on seraphic planetary government, there is a section about the reserve corps of destiny. This questioner states: probably because of my math background I have always been confused by one paragraph. \"The cosmic reserve corps of universe conscious citizens on Urantia now numbers over 1,000 mortals\". Is this group separate from the reserve corps of destiny? The reason this has always puzzled me is that the book states that the present number of reservists is 962 and then goes on to say the cosmic reserve corps numbers over 1.000. Thanks so much for all the wonderful lessons and spiritual guidance. The archives have been a grounding stability for me as well as an enlightening and joyful experience.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your effort at submitting a question to clarify your understanding. I must make a couple of points. First is that I am often asked to somehow corroborate this Urantia Book. I am oftentimes at odds [with the process], because I am asked to defend a text which I did not author and which was delivered quite some time ago as your history goes. And so I am faced with the challenge of seeing past the curiosity of exact numbers and attempting to get at the larger concepts and even ideals that are promoted in this fifth epochal revelation.\nI am going to make a comparison here to illustrate my point. Imagine if you would, a great event occurring on your world fifty years ago, and at that time, your very best reporters covered the event on your world and wrote with the most integrity and sincerity a detailed account of this event to transpire on your world and provided many details, perhaps [reporting about the] number of lives touched, the time frames, and even personal perspectives.\nThe day after such an event you would readily pick up the newspaper and eagerly read for numbers and details and very specific aspects of this story. If this was a big enough and grand enough event you might cut this page out of the newspaper and perhaps tack it to your clipboard. If this event was extremely significant you might remember it and recall it for months to come but remember that this event was fixed in time, the details provided were pertinent only to that time, that moment when it was observed and recorded.\nOne year after such an event, the newspaper attached to the clipboard would be yellowed and fading. Five years from that event you would not refer to it except occasionally. One decade later it might be hard to recall such an event. One generation later a story might be told to a grandchild. All of these are relating back to an original event. In your citing this passage in the Urantia book, the key word that brings this point home is the word now. It implies all I am trying to bring across with this imagery that \"as of now\", fill in the blanks.\nIt is my hope that the process we are engaged in now and have been engaged in over these last number of years of the teaching mission and now the correcting time will bring the concepts and the principles that were outlined so well and with such divine inspiration in the Urantia Papers, that this teaching mission will bring these concepts alive into this time \"as of now.\" But none of the numbers, statistics and details may exactly transfer because this is not the time that is referred to and while concepts and principles span eternity, numbers and facts and figures are very static.\nIt is as though a snapshot was taken and after that snapshot was taken no more consideration is given to change. You can only see how it was in the picture, not how it is now. So I encourage you to allow for the principles and concepts outlined in the Urantia book to be brought into your current realm of awareness and understanding. But that you also allow, that in this moment, in your moment, in your life, in your time, the exact numbers and details will be your own snapshot of time, your own encounter with reality. To talk of numbers when the text was presented 50 years ago has very little relevance to the concepts that are attempting to be portrayed.\nAllow the concepts to influence your daily lives and pervade your thinking with a minimal amount of getting bogged down by trying to calculate exact numbers and figures to somehow bring you peace of mind in reconciling the text. Any text is a snapshot in time and space. As of now your life is dynamic and moving and growing and changing moment by moment. I hope that the tools of a text such as the Urantia Book may be integrated into your dynamic, living, growing, changing life experience.\nThank you for these questions tonight, it has been my privilege once again to have this opportunity to address your questions and concerns. Above all I hope that you receive the message that you are part of this grand plan, you are well cared for and your are well on your way even if your are just beginners in eternity.\n",

How can we know that the authentic Monjoronson speaks to any one individual and that the words communicated are reliable and true?\nMonjoronson: ...by saying that those words, the communications, the configurations by which such communications are expressed are unverifiable. You must as a seeker of truth hone your ability to discern truth and to not readily accept any expression that I give through any TR as truth verified. You must, as your sovereign ruler of Nebadon said when he was on your world, if you have ears to hear may you hear. You have within you the Fragment of God; that is your true source of verification. Take what you receive from me through any one of my orifices of expression into stillness with the divine Parent of whom you are the child. There you will receive your validation, or there you will receive notice to further your spiritual progress. That may mean not paying attention to my contact with you. That may also mean clarifying your conceptual frameworks such that you are able to receive my contact.\nI am not here to prove to you that I am who I am.

        "title": "Limitations in the Translation of Spirit to Human Language",
        "Body": "Question:  Mary: This questioner would like to know why the Spirit of Truth is referred to as \"It,\" the pronoun \"It\" as opposed to the pronoun \"He.\" They feel the Spirit of Truth is the Spirit of Jesus which has personality though they would prefer the genderless \"He\" pronoun. They say spirit may not have gender as we know it in human life but the Spirit of Truth has personality to them. Is there any particular reason behind this?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. It illustrates the nature of the difficulty we face in translating concepts into human word forms or word symbols. I invite you in all your readings of printed materials, to make every attempt to derive the meaning and value without getting hung up or derailed by the choice of words that any author may choose to use. In a sense, these limitations of language are quite restrictive. There are only so many words to be used and in only so many combinations and one can endlessly debate whether there is gender involved or not involved and if so what is the proper use of terms, punctuation, capitalization and a myriad of other distracting elements for what is trying to transpire. I invite you to try to see beyond all of these limitations and take the underlying tone of truth, the grain of truth that is being attempted of description and allow the variation of thought forms.\nSimilar difficulties are encountered in the translation of values and meanings from one language to another. In some languages it is most important to put the gender descriptive well ahead of all other descriptions and in other cultures it's almost entirely absent. Does this change the meaning of what is being attempted to describe? Only if you make it so. If you insist upon 100% accuracy in this process we are undergoing right now, we are destined to fail to meet your expectations for we are even now in my attempt to answer your inquiry, in an ongoing process of translation. My thought patterns are being transcribed in real time into the thought patterns of this transmitter/receiver and therefore they have undergone certain changes right there.\nThen the material itself can be interpreted in a number of ways.\nThis issue of spirit having gender for instance, spirit is quite genderless, therefore spirit of any kind is free from gender. Therefore referring to \"It\" as \"It\" could be quite appropriate. When referring to Michael in any regard, we may attach \"He\" because we know Him to be a male of the species. But to trip on this distinction surely means that meaning and value can be missed or lost in favor of grammatical accuracy and I invite you to rise above the temptation to discern with the strict analysis of the mind and rather be open to the interpretation of the heart and the spirit.\nYou know when you talk to a friend on the phone, they may not even finish their sentence and you know what they mean because you are discerning the underlying message and the tone of what they are trying to say and so you are not concerned when they mis-speak or mispronounce or even fail to finish their thought for you have granted this flexibility between you. Likewise, I invite you to allow this same sort of allowance be made in the discussions that you are exposed to from one such as myself. We are all trying our best to get messages across many different barriers and across many different dimensions. Therefore we do our best, grammatically and to maintain sentence structure and cohesive thought patterns.\nI hope this serves by way of explanation, thank you.\n",

        "title": "What Cup Will You Choose",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  There is much on this world even in this hour to be concerned with but I must point out that we are not here to make this world a perfect place. You each one are perfect in your own way, you have the capacity for perfection and you are the ones in this world. So what will you create, what will you tolerate, what will you endorse, what will you be in this process?\nBecause, there is not a grand force being unleashed upon you, you are both individually and collectively choosing what you will accept, what you will do, what you will have, what fears you will maintain and how those fears will direct your choices.\nI would use an analogy. You are all gathered around this table. I pour for you coffee from a pot into a variety of cups. You then choose, your own choice, your own cup. Now the cup does not change the coffee but the cup is your choosing how you will interface with reality. Do you want a fancy cup, an expensive cup, a small cup, a large cup? What does that cup say about how you will experience the coffee? This life is a coffee cup, your job is a coffee cup.\nEvery condition that you find is simply a coffee cup, a way to negotiate the coffee, the life, and therefore we must make our choices based not upon how we would color our experience through the choice of these temporary experiences of the coffee but rather how will we express ourselves through this process no matter what cup we happen to be holding, what job we happen to be doing, who happens to be standing in front of us or what the task of the hour might be.\nI perceive that you all join me in this mission of wanting to spread this good news to your brothers and sisters that they are encircuited and as such they are safe, they are secure, there is nothing of peril to the one who is spirit born, nothing to fear. It is all simply different aspects of the spiritual experience.\nNow your mortal experiences, your individual experiences will vary radically. They will be conditioned largely by your choices. Do you make the most of it or do you let it dictate what you perceive it would dictate to you. I say we be about this process with intention, with purpose, with the knowledge that we are all safe. There is no harm that can befall any one of us, to the part of us that endures, the part of us that matters, the part of us that is real in amongst all the other shadows.\nI encourage you not to invest yourselves in worries, fears, doubts about what might come to pass, what could come to pass, what is predicted to come to pass, what is possible to come to pass because I tell you plainly most everything you can conceive of will never happen. You cannot conceive of what will happen so therefore free yourselves of the burden of carrying around ideas of what is to come and instead invest yourselves in creating what is to come because the outcome is determined by you. The circumstances may arise before you but it is still your choice how you will negotiate them, how you will react to them, what you will make of this, how you will have your coffee.\nSo do not make the mistake of condemning yourselves to creating the reality that your fear would have you create. Your doubts, your uncertainties, your fears, they would offer you an alternative reality. Don't choose that one. Choose the one that feels like you are partnering with your inner voice, the one that feels the highest in your evaluation of the process. Choose that one, choose the ideal, choose the spectacular, even embrace the unknown because I tell you that is the greatest force for creating your future, not what is going to happen outside of you, around you but what is going to happen inside of you, within you, as you.\n",

        "title": "The Future is Not Pre-Ordained",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  First I will make comment on your observation of apparent predictions that have been made by your brethren, both of the past and even currently. The inherent problem with any individual making broad predictions about future affairs is that these predictions are based upon the extrapolation of conditions as they exist at the time of this exercise in prediction. And to one who is traveling down this path of future observation they may in fact be witnessing a possible avenue of the unfolding of future events if all factors remained constant with their platform of observation. However, as you are learning in this process, we are involved in an ever fluctuating environment and many new factors may be added to the equation that were certainly unforeseen and not taken into account at the time of such predictions or prophecies. You are growing in your awareness that the Father has all options under consideration as pertain to your wide variety of choices, and there is no choice that you can make that is not in some capacity foreseen and provided for. But what is unforeseen may be unforeseen to you as life unfolds and new factors are added to your paradigm of understanding.\nThe choices that you would have so clearly made under one set of circumstances would not at all be so obviously made under a new set of understandings, and therefore it is true that even unto this very moment that the game is in fact in play. If this were not so then your freewill choice would amount to nothing. On the one hand your freewill choice does manifest and dictate your reality both individually and collectively, and on the other hand all possible and potential choices are foreseen by the Creator. It is not that they are fore-ordained by the Creator that you must choose or that you would choose or even that you would most likely choose any of the options available to you, rather, all options are indeed yours to choose.\nThen as a result of your choices you change your paradigm of operation and are confronted with your next set of choices based upon the choices you made to bring you to that point.\nThe problem with predicting the future is that the human will remains unpredictable and in flux in relation to the environment of the moment, and as factors to the environment the natural choices that result will fluctuate to support the evolutionary stage of the one doing the choosing. This is where your enigma of time presents itself.\nYou perceive these choices in a linear fashion based upon your progressive attainments, and therefore you are tempted to extrapolate out beyond your current experience and predict that which will occur based upon your current understanding and direction. But so much is in play in your environment that by the time you are proceeded in a given direction your environment has shifted and your awareness has elevated and subsequently more choices, and your direction may change as a result.\nAll of these factors are positive contributors to another of your thought patterns stated, that being that you are co-creators in this process of bringing about that which you choose. Since these elements are in flux you are able to direct them by the use of your willful intention, and, if this is the case, then it could very well be said that the future has not been written yet because you have not created it yet. You are learning about these tools that you can use to redirect your future and to create for yourselves that which you would desire as opposed to that which others would tell you will come about one day or will surely transpire because of human nature. You are fully aware of human nature, and, if each of you stopped to consider, you could plot out what you consider would be the course of human activities given your limited understanding of where your brothers and sisters are in this process, but your understanding is indeed quite limited of the collective consciousness that pervades your species.\nWhile you are beginning to understand the power and potency of personal co- creative responsibility, you may be still relatively unaware that the same phenomenon exists among the collective consciousness of the brotherhood of humans. That is another factor which is at play in your equation of understanding. As well there is the divine factor of the manifestation of the will of the Creator. While not usurping the individual's freewill declarations, there is nevertheless an overriding direction that represents the desire of the Creator.\nThis willful intention as well is a contributing factor to what will transpire, and as you have all grown in your awareness to understand what the will of the Father and the will of the son represent shall become manifest. So I would encourage you to adopt the attitude that you are writing your own future as you go. It is not preordained that anything must happen or should happen, but rather that anything could happen when you are a partner in this co-creative process of bringing about your destiny and the destiny of your world. We are attempting in this process to empower you as individuals into realizing the role that you play and the function that you have in the unfolding of your individual ascension careers and the ascension career of your race as a whole, and you are rising to the opportunities.\nIt is glorious to see you putting yourselves in the game and changing your point of perception from being that of one on the sidelines to that of one involved in the game. It is most pleasing to witness your empowerment as we proceed forward with this project of individual and group growth. I would contain my remarks to those and allow for interjection by any others.\n",

        "title": "Guiding The Spiritual Growth of Children",
        "Body": "Vicki: I’m going to begin with kind of an experiment today, and I hope this is amenable to the transmitting process. As I contemplate the content of your lessons, I see a vision unfolding, one that prescribes for us in simple terms, how to prepare our children spiritually. And I would like to share this with our readers, as a brief summary. This is not intended to replace or dilute the depth of your messages, which are so valuable to our understanding, nor is it to be considered as the complete picture, but instead to bring to the surface key points you have expounded upon. What I would like to do is read this short summary, paraphrased from your words, and then ask for your input. Is that alright?\nMonjoronson: Most certainly; let’s experiment.\nVicki: Okay. From your lessons, we learned that spiritual growth and development unfolds best through a gentle and continuous exposure to the presence of God, encompassed and applied in the fabric of our daily lives. You speak of one’s need to be accepted socially as equals, regardless of age or handicap. You caution us not to let children miss out on frequent interactions with other children, and also those early challenges that build strong character and self esteem. But you tell us to serve as guides for them through the process. You speak of both the negative and positive impacts that environmental influences and adult role models have on their development. This impact occurs as early as the moment of conception and continues on through their lives. You suggest that we raise children morally and ethically, as God knowing—not God fearing—and you suggest that we assist them in seeing themselves as sons and daughters of the living God, who has planned a future for them.\nNow, having shared this, have I captured the main points here, or is there more you wish to add to my summary?\nMonjoronson: Only one thought, and that is that children be brought into the world, and then raised into adulthood with an intention.\nIt is important that parents hold this intention in mind through the years of their child’s existence in their home. This intention may be written out on a plaque and placed in the child’s bedroom, or in the parent’s bedroom, where it is there to become aware of and not forgotten. Intention is important, and this is a personal and private enterprise between the parents and the child. This is something they devise on their own, for the child.\nAnd when I say, “intention,” it is not for the child to become an accountant, or lawyer, or a company owner, or a being of that material nature, but I am speaking of the intention of raising the individual to become as I said earlier, to be God knowing, to become aware that he or she is a child of the living God, and they are living sons and daughters of that living God, and that their lives came into existence through intention, that there was commitment on the part of the parents to have this child, purposely and intentionally.\nThank you.\n",

        "title": "The Little Ones Who Pass  are Cared for, They Are Safe.",
        "Body": "This question refers to an aspect mentioned in the Urantia Book which is the nurseries, so to speak, that children who pass on early from this mortal life to the morontia realms are cared for in the nursery until the parents arrive also in the morontia realms to continue caring for them. This question refers to that and is as follows. At what time during life are young children translated from Urantia to the nursery? If a child is aborted during pregnancy are they translated? Are they translated if they pass away directly after childbirth or is it at a specific age limit? There are several of my neighbors that lost young ones and it would be nice to reassure them with some information about the ages and other limitations, thank you.\nMonjoronson: I appreciate your question and your concern as to the welfare of the little ones. Nothing tugs at the heart quite so seriously as a desire to be sure that the little ones are cared for, that they are safe and well. As parents, this runs so very deep in your composition, it is truly what you might refer to as instinct, so very basic and such a part of any parenting experience. I would seek to assure all who hear these words that nothing, no one is ever lost whether it be the young child or whether it be the elder who passes away. All are cared for lovingly and graciously, all are ministered to absolutely and completely.\nNo matter what happens to you or at what age it happens to you, you are equally ministered to, taken care of and your essence, your true self remains intact and moves forward in the process. In the case of the unborn or the barely born who have not had adequate opportunity to develop any form of significant relationship, they will have the opportunity to try again and so they are not lost either. They may not be developmentally attached to any other individuals in the material realm for they simply have not had the opportunity to develop this attachment and if this is the case they are given another opportunity to come forth in the expression of a mortal of the realm.\nThey need not be translated because they never got an opportunity the first time and it is required that you have some experience in this mortal realm to relate to. This is the beginning of your ascension career and it would not quite do for you to skip it and go directly on to your next class. There is purpose in your experience here in this realm which is why it is significant to note that every effort should be made to allow for this experience and not to rush through it or to abort the mission of being a creature in this material realm. But if the vicissitudes of life dictate otherwise and if you have had some time to adequately manifest this experience, then you are lovingly and carefully transferred and ministered to on a different plane.\nBut if your journey was simply too short and you were unable to have any experience of the material kind, then you are encouraged and allowed to try again and not to move ahead until you have had some chance to gain the necessary experience that this life is designed to bring to you. But in all cases, in every case, whether you live an extra long life as was referred to in the last question or whether your life was cut short prematurely due to the acts of time and space, you are lovingly ministered to and nothing of value that you are or have done is ever lost. It simply is carried over and if your experiences were inadequate, there are special places where you may go to make up for this premature exit to your initial experience.\nThe overall theme is that you are safe whether you are here or there, whether you are young or old, whether your life appears to be as you would judge it to be good or whether your life appears to be challenging or fraught with difficulty, these are valuable experience and each one, every one will be turned towards the good and will be made to bring you the divine grace that this entire ascension career is designed to furnish you with. So be not afraid for yourselves or for the little ones. I know it is very difficult to have this perspective when you are so concerned about your role as parents and protecting the little ones but you must understand you have parents much larger than you who are overseeing your protection and your children's protection as well and if you would trust that this is so you will begin to see that any and every circumstance will be infused with grace and will be used for goodness.\nThank you for your concern that this question illustrates. It is one of the noblest traits of your humanness that you show such concern and compassion for the young and the needy. Let this motivate you to do all that you can to support these young ones and these ones in need but also realize that the long term perspective would tell you that all is well even if it does not appear well at any given moment to you.\nThank you for your question.\n",

        "title": "Comments Concerning One’s Choice for Extinction",
        "Body": "Question: I have read transcripts from you and from other celestials concerning the extinction of certain morontial souls. I know that our free will is sacrosanct, but I also know that we don’t allow children to make decisions that we know will bring them harm. No one sees that as violating the rights of someone’s free will.\nWhy is it that certain morontia beings that cross over to the other side are allowed to make a decision for extinction? Would they have made such a decision if they had been raised on a more normal world, a world that was not stained by rebellion? How can it be fair to allow such a monumental decision to proceed? Even though they may be adults from a human standpoint, are they not children from a universe standpoint? Why are they allowed to vote themselves out of existence? Is this not a kind of universal assisted suicide? I appreciate your response.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for that question. You are perceptive in the details regarding such a crucial choice in the career of an ascending soul. The primary directive is that free will is sacrosanct, and that the Father, while bringing life freely to all personalities, will never require one to continue existence without their willingness.\nYou speak of our protecting children who make wrong decisions until they mature and can make a greater decision, more healthy, safer. A morontia being, an ascending human, who chooses not to survive, while young in his ascension career, has attained the level of consciousness that is deemed mature in regards to this decision of eternal survival.\nAll elements of what you may describe as therapy and counsel have been completed. The options are clear, and the decision is never emotional. It is a whole-soul choice independent of exterior stresses or pressures. While it brings a solemn sadness to those around that individual, in a sense it is a holy decision because that soul in confidence with God has so chosen. It is the will of the Father that all personalities are manifest for all eternity, but it lies in the secrets of divinity as to how eventually all personalities will be manifest for eternity.\nIt is beyond our knowledge as to the methods by which the Father will bestow every possible personality manifestation. Once such a being reenters into the potentials resident within God the Supreme we do not know what may transpire subsequently. So this ascension career stops, but it is a mystery as to what may ensue in some other form, in some other dimension, at some other stage of universe unfolding.\nIt is the Father’s love that gives life. It is the Father’s mercy that will not require the forced continued living when a sane and certain decision has been made. This underlines the great importance each one of you has in choosing to continue your ascension career. You need not ever feel obligated to make the ascent; the Father will not even condemn you if you do not. He gave a gift; if you do not want it, that is your choice. But the Father God has powers beyond our comprehension as sons and daughters, and it lies within the secrets of His being as to what may follow in ages to come. There may be a destiny that awaits such a soul, but it will not be the ascent to Paradise.\nPerhaps this will stimulate your further musings\n",

        "title": "Educational Expectations in the Universe",
        "Body": "Preamble: These questions go to the concept of how we do or do not study the epochal revelation to answer our own questions about spirit. These questioners also want to address what it is they ought to do to gain greater insight beyond the materials available to study.\nQuestion #10:  There are undoubtedly many causes that would keep an individual from using all the materials available at their disposal. Could you address some of the causes and how we might prevent ourselves from falling into the trap of failing in the midst of plenty?\nQuestion #11:  They also have another question that is somewhat of an opposite problem to the one just expressed. Is it possible to exhaust resources about how to find spiritual insight, even about commonplace material experiences. How do we reach in further when revelation is exhausted?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for these concerns. I sense a line of thinking that has a certain goal in mind for an individual to make by a certain time or in this certain life. Your use of terms like failure to achieve a certain point bring with it certain judgments that there is a required curriculum that all on this world should get in a certain timely fashion with some specific materials, some gigantic test to be taken at the end to see if you have been exposed to enough materials and have done your homework enough to be able to make the grade or pass the course.\nThis attitude, while commonly shared as a result of your experiences on this world of schooling and grading and passing and failing is not the universal concept. Rather, there is no failure on this world, it is not proper to refer to success or failure on this world in the same way you cannot be definitive on the success or failure of a kindergartner. It is all relative and based upon the apparent success or apparent failure of those around and in a universal scheme as large as incorporate your spiritual ascension, such judgements simply are inconsistent with the overall reality.\nIt is good and right and noble to pursue your learning of everything that interests you and sparks your desires and interests. The universe has brought you these things and it will continue to bring you all that you seek for the act of seeking solicits to the universe that you are ready and then as if by magic, you are provided with that which you were seeking. However, different avenues of approach, different materials available will have different meanings and different purposes to all that come in contact with them. It is not required that a given set of materials be present within an individuals concept frame for them to have considered to have gained the important lesson of this life which is the awareness of your eternal ascension career.\nThere are individuals who by circumstance of their location or status may never have the opportunity to be exposed to some of that which you consider to be most relevant and pertinent on this world today and yet through their diligence, through entering into stillness where all answers reside, through their sincere application to exploring their spiritual dimension will make far more progress so to speak, in the classroom of spiritual ascension than may others who are quite privileged and have the opportunity for many fine materials to come their way and yet do not take the personal effort to explore these materials enough to make good and worthy use of them.\nTrust that as you seek in the universe, surely you will find; even the monk on top of the mountain, as he seeks, surely finds. The Father has no limitations on how He will minister to you. It will be as you need it, when you need it, every time and there is no great competition or striving for grades which happen, it is rather a passive process, an invitation to join the Father, one which you accept with joy and gratitude and pursue with eagerness and diligence but one which is not forced but rather offered. In this way, all will arrive in their own due time after having their own unique experience and they will not be judged, the one better than the other. They will be complementary pieces on the great mosaic and puzzle that is being assembled by the Father.\nThank you for this question.\n",

        "title": "Expanding the Spiritual Box",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Recall, if you will with me now, what it was like for you as a small child when you first encountered your first opportunity to play with a box. Recall how it felt for you to crawl inside this containment and to feel the environment within. Remember realizing the sense of your containment and confinement in this object you had been drawn to and your sense of security. You may have called it a fort or a house. At first you may have found yourself a small box, one that you could fit in maybe just barely. If you were lucky enough as a child and as you grew, your love for being contained within an environment like that provided you with even larger boxes, refrigerator boxes, appliance boxes. These brought you such a sense of enjoyment because they were a new boundary, a new sense of definition for yourself.\nThen you were told that those boxes were child's play, but that the new box you should adopt was the box of your room in your house as you grew up. You were told that this box defined the boundaries of your space, and you were able to fill the space up with your stuff. Things that you enjoyed, things that you identified with, things that brought you pleasure all found their way into this box to surround you as you slept in peace enjoying knowing the boundaries of that box.\nThen as you grew further you as adults have enjoyed living in boxes that you are now currently in. These boxes provide for you your current limitations of what is inside your domain and what is outside your domain. You still have the sense that you have control and awareness of all that is inside your box at this point but that things may happen outside your box which you are unaware of. There may be others outside, there may\nbe animals present, there may be weather patterns that exist all of which you may relatively or completely be unaware of as you enjoy your inner environment in your current box.\nNow recall for me, with me, the feelings that you have had when you have entered a great big box, perhaps a cathedral, perhaps a stadium, perhaps a place of vast size but still contained. Recall your feeling of expansion of your soul to be in such a large box, to shift your perception and awareness from your current limitations of square footage to expand out into the great cathedral hall or the vastness of a theater. You were experiencing this expansion in your box. Even though this was a temporary experience you can recall that entering a cavernous box allows you to feel a sense of expansion.\nIt is my desire to reference you to these various stages of your box, even within your life. While these boxes that I have described have been physical and dimensional, there is a spiritual parallel to this experience. First your box of spirituality is exceedingly small, and you are comforted by your limitations, by your feelings of knowing your boundaries. As you grow spiritually your box size increases, and you may decide that this box is no longer adequate to provide for your spiritual presence and decide to upgrade to a bigger box much as you might upgrade from a small apartment or house into a larger dwelling to accommodate your needs.\nThis pattern is one that you can identify and come to be in awareness of as you now are examining the parameters of the box that you are currently within. There may indeed come a time when you desire to go, as was referenced, from the smaller box to the refrigerator box to the house to the cathedral to the stadium. This is a natural progression of evolution, and one need never feel as though any time spent in any one of these environments is ever lost. You were quite comfortable as the small child climbing into the smallest box into which you could fit, but as an adult you might be interested in having more room to expand, grow, and to be. But all these boxes imply that you are on the inside and the rest of all, everything there is, is on the outside.\nThe final frontier will be to first make these divisions opaque [sic] and clear enough to see that there is no great distinction between you on the inside and everything else on the outside, and then to rise to the challenge to encompass your spiritual world as your new box, without the current material restrictions that you have grown accustomed to.\nIt is a joy to play with your imagery of boxes as a means to demonstrate your growth in experience. I would rest there with that ... and provide the time for others. I have enjoyed sharing once again energy signatures and commingling our presences together.\n",

        "title": "Maintaining a Spiritually Receptive Posture",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  You have been told that we speak with one voice when we are in service and in communion with you, whether it is myself, your Father Michael, Mother Spirit, your beloved and worthy teacher Elyon, or perhaps one individual's inner voice. There is a shared voice that no matter who is delivering the message and to whom the message is being delivered, there is a constancy of spirit, and that much of your ability to receive is in fact in your posture of willingness to accept from this teacher, from that source, at this particular time, under these particular conditions.\nOnce you expand your arena of willingness, expand your box, you will begin to see that spirit influence is present in all things. Contained in all messages there is an element of spirit; there is a certain underlying truth, and that it is you who rate the significance or importance of these messages based upon the perceived author or the conditions under which messages were received or the manner or fashion in which messages are received. Many outside of this Teaching Mission do not grant what we do here in this hour any authority, and therefore they remain unreceptive to any spiritual messages contained. So I point out to you that we are all one in this process.\nOn our side we are united in our efforts to commune with you and to bring you spiritual insight. On your side you may be united as well in receiving spiritual communication from any and all sources available to you. I share with your being impressed with the caliber of such a spiritual message as we just witnessed together, but I tell you that this spiritual encounter was no greater or lesser than any other spiritual encounter except in our acceptance of it and appreciation for it. The more appreciation we bring, the greater acceptance we allow, the more spirit content gets through.\nLike you, I remain in a spiritually receptive posture, and I was greatly impressed with the magnitude of such a lovingly devoted exchange. But the real challenge before us may be to increase our awareness and be spiritually receptive to the many, many sources of spiritual inspiration which are directed at us.\nLet us pray for increased capacity to take in any message, every message, all the messages that are meant for us, that are available to us as a result of our opening ourselves up to these potentials and desire of our Father that this be so.\n",

        "title": "Validating the Spiritual Experience",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  This is Monjoronson on behalf of all those who hold on to that which you have grown to be exposed to.  As the child becomes exposed to a great many things, they are unable to retain upon initial exposure all that they have been exposed to. In the process of growing up as a child it is necessary to be exposed and then re- exposed to that which you will one day have complete conviction of and total command of. Likewise is it true of your spiritual childhood. You are reaching out to your universal parents, and you are being exposed to a great many principles, truths, and realities that are currently just outside of your abilities to recognize and command them.\nThat is why we will repeat aspects of our lessons and re-expose you to principles and truths that are filtering in to your understanding and awareness. But there comes a time for the child and for the developing spiritual being that you grow to encompass the formerly new principles as new and adopted truths. There comes a time when the child does not question that two and two equals four. Likewise there comes a time in the development of the spiritual child where no longer is there doubt regarding the reality and validity of that which has been gleaned in the process.\nYou are constantly adding to your resource base. You have gone from basic addition to the more complex aspect of mathematics, and likewise you are going from the most simple and basic comprehension of your relationship to this process, to a deeper understanding of your role and association with all that you have been exposed to. Your mortal development has dictated to you that you are correct in your understanding when what you understand in the agreed upon norm, that is, you are correct in the mortal realm when your associates and peers all seem to concur that this is so.\nThat is how you have derived your sense of security of having gained your mortal wisdom, when you are acknowledged by your peers as being correct.\nBut now we have entered a new arena, a new process, in which your spiritual gleanings are your own personal private possessions. They are not open to scrutiny or evaluation by any other mortal of the realm. Rather they are only identified by you as the true or untrue, as being valid or invalid, through your own internal evaluations of the process and your capacity of awareness. However this is a natural tendency of your order to seek others to support awareness levels, to bring you validity in your level of understanding, and so you enjoy the company of this group, of each other. You attempt to validate that you are not alone in this process of growth and awareness through interaction with others and the support of others when they concur with what you are attempting to validate through your expressions.\nYou are all indeed fortunate that you have each other in this process for if you were located in some cave remote from all associates you would in fact experience great difficulty determining where reality had its boundaries. But in a group of such love and support as you enjoy, as we enjoy in this moment, you are afforded all the comforts and security available through the human realm. As well, because you have chosen, you have access to the support and comfort from all of those on my side of the veil who bring this to the arena that we share. In this way you are indeed fortunate and among a decidedly few number of individuals who enjoy such an environment of support.\nAs it so happens in this process, there is contrast. There are individuals who will present challenges to that which you hold dear. There are individuals who do not validate that which you know about this process. There are even individuals you will encounter who will declare all that you know to be false, but I would point out that anything you have attained in your own citadel of spirit is unassailable. You are earning spiritual advancement step by step, and nothing, no advancements that you make in this process, are subject to any other individuals condemnation or judgments whatsoever. It is truly a challenge to hold dear and fast to that which you know.\n",

        "title": "You are Creatures of  a Herd Mentality",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  You are creatures of a herd mentality. This is your heritage, and many times you look to the herd for your identification and validation of your place and position amongst the herd. When you assemble a herd such as you have in this moment, then you are creating the environment whereby you may flourish due to the supportive nature of your fellows. Take all the solace and comfort that is to be derived from your association and relationship in this such loving environment because the herd of humanity is diverse.\nThere is great uncertainty out there; there is even great fear and great doubt that will arise as a result of the contrast you provide with your very possessions of spiritual advancement. These possessions are yours. No one can take them from you unless you allow them the authority to strip you of that which you know, that which you have earned, that which is certain to you throughout. These things remain unassailable unless you allow ones from the outside to penetrate your citadel of self.\nYou are quite mature in the eyes of the Father and in our eyes, even though we understand fully and completely your limitations and imperfections. But you are as well children of God, the First Source and Center. You are in fact heirs to the throne of perfection. And so we will continue to support your program throughout regardless of any doubts or uncertainties or attacks that may arise from without.\nThese are of no concern to us, but I empathize with you, you herd creatures, that they may in fact be quite a challenge to rise above. But that is exactly what we will do throughout this process. We are rising above step by step. We are raising our vibration level; we are raising ourselves above the fray of human existence to become spiritualized creatures, no longer as subject to the winds of mortal change as we were before we became aware of our positions and relationship to the process.\nHold steady, my dear ones, to the ground that we have gained in rising above. Do not falter that others do not understand, do not comprehend, do not agree, do not provide you validation. I am here to provide the validation; we are at your service to provide you validation. The Father desires nothing more than to validate you, His children. There in fact is no more valid thing to be done than that which you are engaged in, even in this hour.\nTherefore be of joy and lightheartedness as you hold on to your convictions, your understanding, your awareness. Do not let the paths of others determine what your path will be. Allow that all paths are in fact circling the same direction. While there is contrast there is also certainty and security in that which we have gained in this process. It is not required of you that you are perfect; it is not possible of you that you are perfect, but you are striving for perfection, and that is possible. You are reaching for perfection, that is fact. You are making certain progress, that is a visible phenomenon.\nI hope I bring you my sense of conviction and whatever authority that you grant that I have in this process. I am most pleased to have such devoted partners in this process, fully realizing who I am working with, where you are in your spiritual childhood and as well, where we are going. Fear not, my dear ones, only have joy, only have love. Let these disruptions and disturbances pass as choppy waters.\nYou are becoming experienced enough to navigate through such waters with comfort and security. You are my partners in this process in whom I am so well pleased, so accept my contributions to balance the contributions of any other. Hold fast to that which you know, that which you are in this process. It is not changed by the judgments of another. Only view these contrasts to secure your footing, to prepare to hold the line fast should there be stumbles, should there be uncertainties.\nThe most enduring confirmation that I may offer you is my enduring commitment to be with you throughout this process, to work with you as you would allow, to complement you wherever possible. This I bring to you as an outside observer but as one who has your best interest at heart as well as the reflection of the desires of the Father above that you be raised up, that we go through this process together.\n",

        "title": "Beyond the Boundaries of Space & Time",
        "Body": "Question:  Mary: My question is what exists outside the boundaries of space? Thank you.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. Every mortal of the realm, may in their own time wish to have an answer to such a question of what is on the other side of the wall, what is beyond the next valley, what is beyond your sight or your knowledge or your realm of experience? This is normal and natural for humans to have this curiosity for what is beyond.\nI am beyond, you are beyond, we are beyond the confines of space. The spiritual component of you and of all humans on this planet will one day venture well out beyond the wall or the valley or over the mountain and realize that there are continually new horizons to see and to arrive at and to cross over and that we as spiritual beings are the ones who will traverse this distance and gain the next horizon.\nIt is quite impossible of description to a mortal being what it is like to shed this physical existence and be solely a spiritual being without the confines of a material location that you currently call your body.\nThere are no equivalents except perhaps an occasional dream state where you are freed from your vehicle and are able to traverse space as if it were no obstacle at all. That is what your ascension career will provide for you, this ability to traverse space and within it its limitations of time into a realm where those characteristics simply don't apply and therefore all of your current references become null and void. The only reference you will have will be your individual being in relationship to other individual beings, all of which are spirit limitless, boundless, timeless and spaceless.\nIt is actually quite busy out in the realm of spirit, there is always a lot going on and rather than the idea that most humans have that space is just an endless series of emptiness and nothingness, when you are in spirit form and not bound by the constrictions of moving through this arena of time and space, all of creation becomes your playground and you are able to traverse incomprehensible distances in the blink of an eye at the suggestion of your will and you quickly grasp that all the former conditions and limitations that so clearly defined your being, your environment and the conditions of your experience are only temporarily in place when you are a mortal of the realm or even a morontia being and that these conditions only exist in these locations and under these circumstances of time and space.\nOnce you transcend these arenas you will realize the vast limitations of awareness and perception that you had when you were surrounded by this cloak of time and space and there will be a great sense of freedom and this will be your opportunity to embrace an entirely new paradigm, one which cannot be described to you as you are a finite creature firmly rooted in time and space and we are attempting a description of the infinite, timeless and spaceless. You can entertain thoughts and have ideas about what this means but you have no experiential resources to draw from. Therefore you cannot know, you can only conjecture and wonder and guess.\nDo not worry, all the answers you seek will be found in this continuing process of ascension. Even such broad topics as what is on the other side of the wall will be answered to your satisfaction as you personally achieve these horizons and go beyond them as a direct result of your efforts at pursuing them.\n",

        "title": "Is Paradise Alive?",
        "Body": "I read a line in the Urantia Book which I cannot find again. It said something like, \"Although Paradise is not a person it is certainly living\" or it may have said \"alive.\" In the Urantia Book there are several places where everyone I ask directs me to, neither of which are the sentences I am sure of having read before. So my question is: Is Paradise living? Thank you for your wise and knowledgeable answer.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your first inquiry. It is difficult to convey to mortals of the realm how systems can in fact be living and alive. You are so accustomed to life being designated by individual life units of mortal creatures and animals which draw breath and exhibit signs of life or they do not, but there are other forms of life which do not follow these strict patterns.\nYour earth, for instance, is quite alive and you might refer to that as a living system for it contains many different elements but nevertheless, it is alive as a system. Your solar system is also alive although it does not show signs of a heart beating or breath being drawn. Yes, Paradise is a living system. It is an energy system that is not centralized and focalized into a specific body but it is nonetheless equally alive and real as you are who are focalized within a specific material body.\nThere are also systems which you are becoming aware of which are very much alive between and among individuals. These systems are created by the contribution of intention between individuals and they are given life by those who donate the energy into the system and then the system itself can be said to be living and alive. Many prayer groups or meditation circles or groups of devoted individuals can witness to you that there is something greater that happens when you combine your intentions and literally create this additional system between you and among you. Your definition of alive is simply what needs to be adjusted to allow for the expanded awareness of what constitutes living and alive. Then you will be able to see that many things which are not contained into one location also qualify as being quite alive.\nYour individual spiritual aspect of self is quite alive and yet it is only attached to your mortal body during this lifetime. Once your body ceases to function, your spirit does not, therefore your definition of living will certainly shift at that moment if not before to accommodate your new awareness that life is not simply a physical manifestation but more accurately defined as an energy system.\nThank you for your question\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  This is Monjoronson. We know that with the advent of the Teaching Mission, to speak and listen to celestial teachers, angels, Melchizedeks, and others has been most unsettling to your stable and staid community. My advent and approach to the moral realm has as well caused great instability and uncertainty in both communities. We have done this because it is necessary. It is necessary to broaden your thinking. We do not want you to become settled into trite and ritualistic ways of thinking and behaving.\nYour morontia career has already begun, do not forget that. Though you are a mortal being on this realm, your morontial career has begun. It has begun in earnest when you began to read the Urantia Book and opening your mind to the broadest parameters of universal existence. It has begun when you began to realize that you have a personal relationship with your Thought Adjuster. It began when you realized that this is the first step of an infinite career that would last many, many hundreds of thousands of years until you are embraced by the Creator. It began when you realized that you were a son of God in the brotherhood of mankind and that your future life was beginning now.\nIt is essential that you understand this and the responsibilities attendant to it. Your responsibilities are to the growth of your soul, to engage the most worthy causes and efforts in your mortal lifetime, to give yourself a repertoire of experiences upon which you can draw in the afterlife. Your morontial life, the remainder of your universal life has already begun and we are here to insure that you do not become too complacent.\nThank you.\n",

        "title": "Sexual Behavior and Spirituality",
        "Body": "Phillip: I am a Brazilian reader of the Urantia book. Our country is known to be the biggest Catholic nation, on the other hand our country is regarded as very liberal when it comes to sexual human behavior. The Catholic church says sex is meant to be used for reproduction however it is not hard to find many people who disagree with this even though declaring themselves to be Catholics. Even the Urantia book says that humans should learn how to enjoy pleasure without debauchery. I would greatly appreciate if you could shed some light into this subject.\nQuestion #1:  How does ones sexual behavior affect his/her personal ascension career and ability to act as a T/R?\nMonjoronson: The Life Carriers have thoughtfully introduced into the procreative cycles of all creatures a drawing power that will insure propagation of species, this incentive guarantees union. While many creatures do not understand the power of that association, they fulfill the needs and perform the function and accomplish the goal. The human race is one though not singly the only one which has developed ritual ceremony and has infused the action with a social element of pleasure as well as the physical pleasure force.\nThis questioner is aware of the Urantia papers and I offer note that it was Adam and Eve and their violet race that encouraged the playful element of such an activity. You spoke of the church and its perspective on such engagements. It derived its notions from an abhorrence of what appeared to be bestial and in its effort to foster what may be called a \"more civilized function\", frowned upon trivialities. It attempted therefore to avoid what seemed to be animalistic on one hand and to avoid what seemed to be indulgent on the other and stripped it down to its primary function which is to procreate.\nThe human race has come to learn the value of intimacy and interpersonal care and love and this engagement is a means where two personalities may deepen their relationship. You will find today that even the churches foster deepening of relationship in the sexual arena, that while the primary function is procreation, a concomitant function is that intimacy and sharing and caring. And so I encourage an element of sanctity that such an undertaking be mutual, communal and not strictly for selfish gain.\nThe activity itself has no bearing upon the ability of a celestial personality to make contact with the mind of a mortal for this interface transcends the animal level. Your rested-ness from proper sleep, your freedom from chemical impairments and your emotional state will help or interfere with the contact of a higher being more than a recent engagement in sexual activity.\nQuestion #2:  Phillip: Is it true that in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment one has to completely give up sexual activity? I thank you in advance for all your insights into this matter.\nMonjoronson: No, indeed, not for spiritual enlightenment is in the realm of mind, the level of superconsciousness and interfacing with the level of soul consciousness. Again this tendency on your world to segregate spiritual pursuits from sexual engagements relates back to the bestiality perspective of the act and also addresses licentiousness and personality control. If you have attained such disciplines, have reigned in your impulses and understand the proper arena for your expressions of sexual activity, you are balancing them with your spiritual aspirations.\nThe act itself does not hinder relationship with God, it is the orientation of the heart and mind of the personality and the values held therein that will interfere with spiritual communion. Underlying such injunctions of abstinence to promote spiritual progress is the distinction between selfish pursuits and the pursuit of altruistic values in a divine parent. Recall that Jesus taught the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of mankind.\nYour relation to God is of primary importance but the corollary is your relationship to one another and so this procreative activity can enhance such fellowship if it is altruistic and not merely a selfish pursuit. I will conclude by stating that many beings of high orders engage in personality embraces, a level of intensity of connection which is a pattern found replicated in your physical activities of sex but we do not require a physical form to act out such embraces and it is done with no purpose to bear offspring and this is acceptable in the eyes of God that there be such connections.\nTherefore I encourage you to spiritualize your sexual activities, to enhance them with the higher values of personal love, affection and care. Be at peace with the fact of your physical emplacement for you are raised up from the animal kingdom and while you are discovering the spiritual kingdom you are a creature of dual origin. Bring nobility to all your actions and be not overly concerned of certain functions which have been born of your animal legacy. Honor them for what they are, do not foster their distortion, enhance them with spiritual love.\nI thank you for the question.\n",

        "title": "The Nature of Portals",
        "Body": "Preamble: A portal, as this questioner understands it, is an opening from one side of the veil to us on a material plane. It is sometimes said that there are some days that a portal may be offered to our world that coincide with our astronomical positions [e.g. the Spring Equinox] or because of the alignment of bodies in our solar system.\nQuestion #8:  Do these types of portals exist at all, and if they do, are they opened when significant astronomical events occur on our planet?\nQuestion #9:  If there are no portals in the sense we have asked about, how can we anticipate the timing of when some spiritual opportunity may come our way for which we would like to greet them and prepare to cooperate with them, perhaps in a co-creative way?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. Inherent in the question I discern that the portal you refer to are events of time and space but as well they are events of intention. There is some intelligence in this process and I will affirm for you that under such a definition, there truly are such things as portals which are activated at will by those with intelligence to do so and intention to do so. As for determining, based upon this definition, the where and the when such portals may be activated, I would say that I can tell you exactly the where and the when such portals may be activated; they are where you are.\nA portal as you refer to it, is nothing more than the activation of the creative act of will. It is the choosing of a co-creative being such as yourself, to leap from this dimension of material confinement into the realm of spiritual freedom and it can be done anytime you choose to do it by simply doing it with that part of yourself which is not encumbered by time nor space; that part of yourself which can be anywhere, anytime, through this point you refer to as a portal which is nothing more than your will and your desire. The moment you choose to activate this portal, this opportunity, your spiritual component may be released from the fetters of its material confines and be allowed to traverse through time and space as easily as you can imagine.\nSo, it is not as though portals come and go because of geological conditions or the rotation of the stars. Such things as might be referred to as portals are the act of creation, the choosing of the co-creative will and then all things are possible. The limitations of time and space simply do not apply when you are in the co-creative spiritual realm. So I encourage you to be about this discovery that you are a portal yourself and see where this window into the universe that you are might lead you and take you.\nThank you for this question.\n",

        "Body": "Question #3:  Mary: Can you tell us if and how sound heals Monjoronson? We have a questioner who had the experience of a cessation to pain in their back after they listened to some demo tracks on a CD of Tibetan singing bowls and sound vibrations on this CD apparently elicited a cessation to the pain in their back. They are curious about how sound vibrations heal.\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your questions and your observations of your personal experience in relationship to sound waves. It has long been studied in some of the religions, this relationship of tone to energy manipulation and it has been pretty well been documented that different tones being of different frequency have been found to correspond to the different energy centers of the body you may refer to as chakras. Often times pain is a symptom which occurs as a result of energy blockage within the vehicle. As you know this series of energy stations in your body called chakras provide the circuitry for an energy field within you that utilizes these stations in your body to transmit energy back and forth thus wiring your vehicle into higher dimensions. When there is a blockage at one of these stations there is a cessation of free energy movement and just as with the circulation of your blood carrying vital nutrients it is imperative that your energy has free pathways to flow just as your circulation has free pathways to flow.\nThese different tones that you refer to have corresponded to these different stations of your electrical system, that is your electrical spiritual system, and have been successfully used to open up these stations along the route to create for greater flow of this energy. It sounds from your observation as though you have first hand experienced the demonstration of what I am describing. Many have on your world experienced this opening up of certain blockages as a result of their response to certain tones.\nYou have a statement on your world that music and tone may be the language of the universe and it is quite true that tones are carrier waves for a great many things and they do not require words or interpretations but rather can get right to the heart of the matter or whatever chakra might be in play. There is much yet to be discovered and utilized in this field of tone therapy but I do bring you certain validation of this universe principle in response to your request.\nThank you.\n",

        "title": "The Seven Psychic Circles",
        "Body": "Mary: [Premise] Thanks for being here Monjoronson. According to the Urantia Book, the Seven Psychic Circles prepare us for our future morontial life and eventual Adjuster fusion.\nQuestion #1:  Would you please expand upon the milestones/levels of attainment we seek as we travel through each psychic circle?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. First let me clarify that the relationship between the Adjuster and the indwelt individual is a sacred and personal relationship. There [are few] intimate details that are available to the spiritual universe, rather we observe the behavior and the growth patterning and certain developments which give us a somewhat accurate and clear picture of the purpose and progress which is unfolding within each and every individual in the universe. It is true that there are spiritual psychic circles, levels if you will, which through the help of the Thought Adjuster prepare the animal human mind for the spiritual morontial experience whether that experience precedes the morontial life or not.\nWithin this concept of the Seven Psychic Circles there is a tremendous amount of activity, activity within the human spirit relationship, activity within the human relationship and activity and the self-relationship.\nAt first the animal minded human ventures forth using the adjutant mind of the Universe Mother Spirit. This adjutant mind enables man to grasp simple common sense things which have to do with existing and living. This slowly yields to a growing relationship with the individual and the Adjuster to a point where the individual becomes conscious enough to whole heartedly dedicate his will to spirit, to the inoculation of the rites of passage from the animal to the spirit. Once the Adjuster mind begins to work within human consciousness, the Adjuster is constantly preparing morontia experiences for the human animal. Man therefore can be seen as shifting from a less animal being to a greater spiritual being. This phenomenon in the spirit universe for your participation in this event is referred to as the Seven Psychic Circles.\nI cannot tell you much more than the Urantia Book can tell you about where a person is at. We do notice that when a person has reached a third psychic circle that individual guardian seraphim are awarded these individuals and there seems to be a much and more rigorous effort of the human to bear spiritual fruit within their human life. The ability to work within the adjutant mind and with spirit influences brings one to the third step. The last inner steps are personally guided to the uninterrupted communication of the Thought Adjuster and the human indwelt. There is much within this concept that is left unanswered so as not to condition the human to an unconditioned event. This initiation passage must be attempted by every individual. Each is unique, each is within its own time and space reference, each is within the capacity of the human mind to grasp meanings and values and to sort out priorities to become fully responsible for the life which you have been given.\nThank you.\n",

        "title": "The Duties of Your Guardian Angel",
        "Body": "Question #1:  In many transcripts, I read that the guardian angels primary duties are to safeguard and protect their human subjects. Since they cannot interfere with the accidents of time or natural course of human evolution, what is it that they are protecting or safeguarding us from?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your good question. The role of guardian angels and the role of guardians of destiny are distinct. They are very similar but they are distinct. Let us involve ourselves today with the guardian angel aspects. Guardian angels protect humans from those travesties of a human course and development which would bring their lives shorter. Guardian angels do become much more involved in an individuals life as that individual commits themselves more and more to their course of development that is being unfolded by their Thought Adjuster. This is truly measurable and observable by the Thought Adjuster and guardian. This is weighed by the increase of the volume or \"weight\" of the individual soul.\nThe guardian's main interest is to assist the individual to become involved and guided towards those developments which fulfill that life plan. So it is not so much from, but to; it's much like the rights written into your constitution or your nation. There are rights to and there are rights from, so it is important to know that distinction. Guardian angels offer themselves and their lives to assist the individual to become more than they are. As the mortal moves ahead in their life they have less and less to be guarded from.\nFurther, the development of your world has become such that guardian angels are allowed to become more active in the lives of their guarded children of destiny; they are allowed to become much more involved and intimate with that individual. Exceptions that are further ahead require the participation of the guardians supervising angel to assist in and to weigh whether to become more involved in that individual's life more dramatically. There is a hierarchy of authority and privileges to express that authority as the line of angelic guardianship ascends towards the Third Person in Paradise.\nThank you.\n",

        "title": "Looking With a New Eye of Discernment",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  Was it real, is it true? Therein lies our next great lab project, to go out into the world and to look at everything with a new eye of discernment for spiritual truth. Your culture has an obsession with wanting to know who the author is and therefore how much credibility to devote to any given work. But we are entering a time when divine truth will be flowing from every seam and crack and individual that is willing to let it flow. Therefore we must adjust our perception to accommodate that there will be truths coming from even such as yourselves that is no less true or no less real than if it had come from a impeccable source.\nThis question arises in this process of transmitting and receiving and projecting out that which people are getting from the outside or perhaps even from the inside. There will be misidentification of authorship. Was it Monjoronson, could it have been Michael? Perhaps Machiventa?, perhaps it was a combined sentiment from \"the other side\". Does that matter in reference to the value contained, to the truths represented? If it is applicable and truthful and righteous, then take it, accept it as the gift that it is from on high. If you are uncertain of the authorship, does that change the validity?\nIf a man on the street offers you a smile and words of wisdom do you discount that because he is not at a pulpit? No. We are growing beyond those limitations. You need not be at a pulpit, in front of a group of individuals that have conferred authority upon you. You need not be anything more than sincere and willing for you each one to be a conduit of truth. You may stumble because you are not certain of the origin of this truth. You may be unwilling to move forward because you have not had a bold proclamation as to who would have you deliver such truths, But my friends, truth is truth and whether it is delivered by the most highs or a stranger passing by, if it is in your presence, likely it is meant for you.\nIf you begin to look at life as potential truth everywhere you will open up vast opportunities for growth and understanding. If you wait to get your truth until the next time we meet, for instance, then how many days will pass where you are not looking for truth, not receptive to the truth in your own laboratory experience. I encourage you to be prepared to find the truth anywhere and everywhere. The Father will use all means available to reach you, to comfort you, to provide you with that which you are seeking. It need not be in any strict form that you should wait to receive it in, rather the true master knows that the truth abounds everywhere and is readily available to any who has eyes to see and ears to hear.\nI encourage you to practice this discernment of truth, not take every statement made as righteous and divine by any means but run each statement and every action through your filter of discernment to glean from those instances what truth may be contained. Your culture has told you to be wary of all things, to trust nothing until it has been proven to you, until it has been given authority. But I tell you that is not how The Father operates. Each of you are receivers and each of you are transmitters of truth as well to the degree that you will allow this to occur. So as you go out and about in the fields of your lives, develop your sense of awareness that truth may be at every turn, at any turn and whether or not you can identify to your satisfaction the source of this truth, the authorship of this truth, make every attempt to not overlook it.\nYou have an accurate filter within. If it is of divinity then it will resonate and ring your truth bell internally. If it is questionable or marginal then you will not have such a profound response and you are also all familiar with the response provided when you encounter things that do not at all resemble righteousness or divinity. You are well aware of the many times you have encountered things which do not sit well with you, that you do not accept and you need now to trust yourself in this process. I say trust yourself but you are not alone in this either, even in your process there is one with you who will confirm for you the validity of the truth contained or will decline to affirm for you that this is material that is appropriate for you.\nYou all have an instinct that needs to be fostered as to what is true and right and good and what does not have those elements, but you cannot practice this and do this accurately if you do not accept that there are many avenues to be examined, that there may be found in any number of sources [things] that do not appear to have divine authorship. Still there may be truths and if you even glean one small aspect of truth contained within a body of work then you have exercised your discernment and you have grown wiser in the process. Be gentle with yourselves as you begin to feel the promptings more clearly in your lives, be gentle with yourselves that these are real.\n",

        "Body": "Question #6:  Discussions with you Monjoronson, sometimes lead us into \"uncertainties\" because most of us accept the statements found in the Urantia text to which we compare your responses. Is it fair to say that what you have to say to us will sometimes tend to undermine our self-satisfaction with the book's answers? Does this confusion in us actually do more good than harm?\nMonjoronson: My presence and my discourses have numerous meanings and purposes, one of which is to create in you a far more discerning and defining mentality, personality, and rational thought process. To didactically accept text statements of truth is to lead yourself into closed end discussions where you must again rely upon the book as a source of wisdom. Our efforts are to lead you into wisdom; our efforts are to encourage you to begin thinking, to discern, to weigh, to sift, to sort, to analyze, give value of serious levels of meaning through the topics we discuss. Your lessons here are to become far more broad-minded.\nAlthough the Urantia Book truly is a mind opening experience to appreciate its complexities, nonetheless to think within the binding of that book limits your capacity to become a co-creator with the rest of your life, with Christ Michael, and the First Source and Center. Your training, dear one, is to become divine, to become perfect, to become embraced by the Creator. In order to do that you must expand your thinking to the broadest parameters, to infinite levels. We begin that process now during your material lifetime by assisting you to challenge what you read in the Urantia Book. Truly it has wonderful truths and illustrations in it, revelations of information which is beyond mortal thinking, but it is only a beginning. It is an opening to ask, \"Now what?\"\nThank you.\n",

        "title": "I Decline to Endorse or Denounce Certain Personalities",
        "Body": "Question: Could you please give an example of a human on Urantia within whom the Spirit of Truth is functioning as a spiritual co-ordinator of the different spirit ministries, and the spirit of the Bestowal Son is present in humans who have no Thought Adjuster and no soul?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. I have been asked before in this forum to offer a certain service, as it were, and to either endorse or denounce certain personalities that are present in the mix on your world and I have before, declined to do so and I will decline again. To bring up specific examples of individuals is rather an infringement on their sovereignty. They are as they are and they are discernible by the universe at large and by you as well. They are known by their fruits. Those who are connected with their Inner Guides live lives which indicate their association with divinity and there are the fruits to be seen and observed by all those who would simply look.\nSo I declare there are many, many on your world right now who would thus qualify as endowed human beings, those who are listening, paying attention and then acting on this internal knowingness. But I caution you against putting such ones as might readily come to your mind on an unattainable pedestal for they are not. They are like you in most all respects. They live a life like yours, similar to you as a human being of the realm. They are mortal beings just like you and they are spiritual beings just like you. They perhaps choose to put more emphasis on relaxing into their spiritual dimension that do others but they are inherently the same as you.\nI point this out and I decline to endorse individuals to illustrate that this is not a far away process. This is an up close personal process. This is not something to be admired and adored in others, it is to be sought and developed within you. As I say, you will be known by your fruits, by your lives as a testament. So rather than the pursuit of who out there is being led by what internal force, perhaps more is to be gained by turning that search within and looking for where spirit influence may be and going in that direction and in so doing your life begins to mimic your spiritual state and before you know it the fruits are quite evident. You will know them by their fruits and they you will know you by yours.\nThank you for this question.\n",

        "title": "The Choices Are Yours",
        "Body": "Preamble: A secondary midwayer chief was discussing the history of the upbringing of the midwayers on Urantia saying how poor their initial education was as young midwayers. In part ABC22 observed that during the Lucifer Rebellion it was, \"Politics my dear brother, a war of words, ideas, lures, controversy and ideals...A great number of us lost the ability to discern right from wrong - God's will from any selfish proposal that suited at that very moment. And gradually, the larger number of us went out of control.\"\nQuestion #6:  May the same be said about Urantia's human population and for some of the same causes? And may that population look forward to the same kind of discipline and attention the midwayers received at the conclusion of the Lucifer Rebellion as part of the Correcting Time?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. That preamble that was offered, I grant you, sounds hauntingly familiar does it not? Truly this world is fraught with examples of individual races, groups, and orders, who have lost their way, who have been overcome by the darkness of materialism and personal self interests. But referring back to the original question tonight, this world provides all realities side by side to be chosen and that is what makes fertile ground for building character, making the individual choices that determine your individual reality and your sphere of self that you take with you.\nTruly these choices represent a gift of grace from on high for you are not ordered which way to choose, you are not directed how to spend your choice. Rather you are given latitude to make your choices and observe the consequences of your actions and then to determine whether the choice was appropriate or not. And here is the good part; you are constantly offered a chance to re-choose. You are not locked into any initial choice or previous choice. Rather, each day, each hour of each day there is an opportunity for you to re-choose. Would you do the same things, say the same things, act the same way, having had the opportunity to experience the results of this choice or would you refine your choice now knowing more about it than you did before?\nIndeed every day that you are present to make choices you are a new and different person resulting from all the choices you made in the previous day and all the considerations about such choices that have changed your perspective and altered your character. I understand and I agree that there appear many sad episodes of individuals and groups, and nations, making poor choices and following paths which have turned out to be fruitless or even harmful but this is how one learns. They may be told that such a choice will cause such a negative adverse effect, but until they encounter this for themselves this is not a lesson, this is merely advice. When an individual knows first hand because they have actuated the potentials and created the reality based upon their choice, then it is real to them. Then it may be harvested as a genuine experience. [The effects of choice are ] not some hearsay or some advice offered but rather as a genuine matter of personal experience and there is no substitute in all the universe for such a value that is received from such a personal experience.\nTherefore must the situation of a world such as this be filled with potential of all kinds and while you have witnessed many poor choices or choices that have led people away from divinity, from God, from connection, from spirit, likewise there are the opposite potentials present as well that may be chosen, that will be chosen when all those who have tried another way will forsake it and try a new way. They will re-choose in the day of their choice, in the hour of their choice they will re-choose and they will choose the spiritual way and it will be because they came to it themselves. They were not ordered from on high or directed by rule of law but rather because they themselves desired it and chose it. While the road may appear difficult to arrive at this place, arriving at this place is what the road was built for.\nI hope this makes sense in context with your question. Thank you.\n",

        "title": "Messages & Messengers",
        "Body": "Monjoronson: Today let us take another look at messages and messengers. I have just witnessed, as have you, the sharing of individuals and their real life experiences and perceptions, and I, like you, have responded to these messages as real and genuine, and they have impacted me as being delivered by sincere messengers.\nThis point illustrates that any of us at any given moment may be called to function as messengers delivering inspiration, perception, and truth as we understand it to the others who are assembled. Whether this truth is simply a matter of personal experience, a matter of personal expression, or wisdom received from on high, nevertheless if delivered through the sincere messenger, each time these messages of truth contain the very seeds of divinity and purity of purpose. They may in fact at any time be incomplete or immature in their assessment and delivery, but nevertheless there is contained some element of truth, some elements of goodness, and certainly some elements of beauty.\nWe all must grow in our awareness that truth will be channeled to us, will be directed to us from all sides, from all angles, and that we would do well to be at the ready, to be prepared to recognize and receive the truth that would be directed towards us. The human species has a tendency to only give credit to sources that have been granted authority, either by the collective institution or by the collective acknowledgment of others that there is one in authority that is capable of directing such truths, when in fact all children of God are so capable of being conduits for truth, that at any moment they may be called upon to act as the messengers to direct the message.\nEach one of you knows the validity of this statement as you find yourselves in positions to be used as this conduit for delivery of whatever the message of the moment may be. Likewise if your senses are keen you will find that others out there are being directed to be used for your benefit and that the individual who is janitor at the school may be in the proper position in time and space to be the one to bring you the message appropriate to you more so than the appointed priest who others would grant this authority to over a custodian. Both may be the messenger; you may be the messenger; I may be the messenger of this moment. We all in a sense take turns fulfilling this role, for the messages are great, and many messengers are required to filter down these messages so that they may be assimilated. Ask first your inner Spirit of Truth the validity of any message you hear before you allow your mind to either substantiate or condemn the message based upon its apparent source. Because as you have been told, all messages of divine nature emanate from one great source; it is only the individual's pen that may be used to transcribe or whose voice may be used to express or whose position of prominence may be accessed to provide maximum benefit.\nBut you may trust that if it is affirmed within the message then it should matter little to you who the messenger is. It is not about highlighting the messengers; it is about illustrating the message. Just as when you are called upon to be the messenger you do not seek the recognition of one who is grand in authority, rather it is your desire to impart the message, even if it is apparently merely your own personal experience, which I offer is one of the most powerful expressions of truth, beauty, and goodness that a mortal of the realm may offer. These messages carry divine tone as well, for they are well earned by the steadfast students and therefore have a power generated from the ground up, as it were.\nSuch messages are powerful because they speak to all the others who come from this place and can relate to messages so well earned. So, speak your truths with authority; they are genuine and real and therefore they are powerful beyond your consideration. And as well seek to discern the relative value of all messages that may come to you based upon your individual yardstick of your Spirit of Truth. In this way there is truly nothing out there to be feared. You may choose, at any moment, not to adopt any teachings and nothing will ever be forced upon you.\nFrom one who is acting as a messenger at this moment, whose privilege it is to portray to you this message, I would acknowledge your worthiness as messengers as well and applaud your efforts at functioning in this role.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I am Monjoronson here to delight with you in the process, in the undertaking and the results which are so spectacular to behold. I understand that from your perspective, the changes that you are aware of may be slight. They may be muted by the dazzling colors and activities and processes all around you but from my perspective, I witness the individual growth of divine beings who are waking up to the realization of who they really are in this process, who are experimenting with ideals about themselves and who are discovering in this process an internal validity to their seeking and their finding.\nAs you are all becoming familiar with, your individual spiritual journey is wholly a personal matter and you are unable to fully share your internal individual experiences with anyone, even your closest associate, as many of the changes that you undergo are subtle shifts which happen so smoothly that it may take even you some time and some point of reflection to acknowledge that there have been some subtle shifts occurring in your internal paradigm. But as spiritual beings there is no disguising your growth, your advancements and your true beauty. I accept your offer of a topic to discuss the topic of spiritual beauty as I am privileged enough to behold this beauty with my senses. That is, I actually can perceive the unfolding beauty that each of you is becoming in terms of light and color and brilliance and magnificence beyond description.\nWhen you align yourself with the purpose of the plan that surrounds you and you willingly undertake the manifestation of that which you are grasping in the spirit realm, then you are as flowers that are opening to the sun, responding to the light. The bud of a rose is in itself, beautiful, contained with so much potential within but never having seen the rose exposed and unfolded you would never truly understand the potential inherent in the bud. I am privileged enough to glimpse some of the earliest stages of your budding in this life and even here where all around you are flowers in their formative stages, there are a few of you who are eager to unfold and to flower and bloom because you have sensed the light.\nYou have perceived this call from on high and you are not only turning to face it but in an even greater response you are endeavoring to unfold your potential to transform from one state of budding potential into a state of potential realized of the bloom of the flower. While you have not certainly fully matured, you are still fresh in this process. Many of you have a great deal of your magnificence revealed and exposed and there is a special significance in being there to observe as the flower changes form before your eyes and becomes what was only a potential pattern at one point.\nIn order to prosper as this beautiful, growing, living, manifesting entity, you crave the light which initially prompts you. You also need much nourishment.  That is what we are about in this process right now. We are providing you the nourishment, the fertilizer, so that you can make the most of this growing season, this short season you have on this planet. The conditions are favorable, the light does shine on you from above, you are planted in good soil and we are bringing you the nutrients and fertilizer that should promote this growth cycle to its very maximum of its capacity.\nIf you could see as I can see that this is what we are about, we are about tending incredibly beautiful gardens of potential flowers many of whom are already blossoming and that we have favorable conditions before us to allow for a large bloom to happen. And so it is that each one of you prepares these flower beds by your very choices, your intention to create this environment favorable to your growth. You are the ones who declare that these meetings will occur and you are there to request the nourishment that you desire in this process so that you may become your full potential.\nAs the one who is tending the garden, it is my supreme pleasure to bring you that which you require to be robust and healthy, to offer you comfort when the winds may blow harshly, to watch over you throughout this process and perhaps be ready to prune away the unnecessary growth and to foster, even to graft on to your growth that which is beneficial and will bear great fruit. But always in this process whether you are the bud or the barely opened flower or the magnificently splendid specimen of all that you can be, you are tended to and cared and loved all the same. You will not mature at the same rate and this provides for even more variation in our flower bed.\nThere will be times when you may feel as though you are pale in comparison and times when you may feel you are brilliant. But all of these times, my dear ones, you are beautiful. You are exactly what you could be and when we see you make these efforts towards unfolding yourselves and becoming more than just the bud we rejoice in every little act and all stages of this are magnificent to behold. You are in process, you are unfolding day by day, you are changing almost by the hour and from our perspective we see that you are all growing as you should be growing, manifesting as you could be manifesting, achieving day by day advancements which make you more and more beautiful in this process.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson:  We do not view beauty in the same way of course as you do because we are in possession of the full realization that the external vehicle is only that, the external vehicle. That you, the real you, the you that is the bud unfolding, is housed temporarily in this vehicle. It will then go on to be housed temporarily in many vehicles before you have no more need of a physical vehicle at all. But all the while it is not the vehicle that we see when we look at you. It is the divine fragment that you are and are becoming in this process.\nSo we are not concerned whether the vehicle is small or big, old or young, we rather concern ourselves with the long term view of the pilot of that vehicle. What do they appear like? These appearances are not similar in any way to what your eyes perceive amongst each other when you view each other. I will reference in your effort to understand this, this moment in time. Let us take a step back and realize that most of you who are calling in on this line have no recognition of what any of you looks like and I will point out to you that you have developed this circuit, this relationship without any concern as to what your physical appearances may be in this hour at this time.\nRather has this means of gathering offered you the unique opportunity to form these relationships and to be involved together without the limitations of what another may look like or act like or smell like or feel like when you were in their presence. Rather you have agreed to form this group and you are getting to know each other on a deeper level so that the real individuals you are identifying and growing a relationship with are more accurately the pilots inside the vehicles rather than the bodies themselves.\nAll of you know of course you must utilize your vehicle, you must also utilize a telephone device. They are both useful to you and necessary in this process for you to make this connection, however neither one of those things is you. You are separate and distinct from any mechanical device or any physical device such as your body. So even in this hour you have a very shadow of a glimpse of what it is like in the spirit world and to perceive things from the spiritual perspective where physical characteristics and traits are simply not very important, certainly not the most important aspect of another and yet on the world in which you must navigate you all are familiar with the impact of first impressions and appearances.\nSometimes these can be so detrimental to your getting to know each other that you never can get past the shape and color of the vehicle to really introduce yourself to the pilot inside. This is one of your greatest challenges and perhaps this mode of communication serves us best in this process because we are all growing in familiarity and comfort with each other regardless what any one of us may appear like in this hour. Indeed I myself have no physical form and yet you entertain me in your conversations. What if I was in some physical form that you would find hard to accept? Then would you embrace my words as easily and as readily, if I had a form which you in your physical life were uncomfortable with in any way?\nYou see, therein lies the quandary where many of you have asked \"why don't you materialize and lead this Magisterial Mission\"? To that I make the statement that if I was to materialize tomorrow I would suffer greatly the restrictions that you take for granted of being trapped in one material vehicle, one body. As such I would not have liberty that I have now to be anywhere I wanted at any time I want; rather would I be a prisoner as you are in your bodies. I will not choose to do this at this time but there will come the necessity for me to walk this earth just as you do and when my hour has come to manifest in such form I will devote myself to that project as I am devoting myself to you in this project at this time.\nTo any parent there is great beauty to behold in every stage of their child's development. It is not that you would wish that your child rush to be something that you know they will be, no, rather it is your desire to savor each moment because they are only toddlers once, they are only young children for a short time, they are only buds in the garden for a short time and then they bloom and they become magnificent. The children grow up and manifest who they really are and each stage is beautiful to the parent, to the teacher, to the one who is observing these transformations, these changes.\nAll of you are beautiful exactly where you are. I would change nothing, only I would enjoy, I would drink this cup with each one of you for the progress you have made, the maturity you have gained and yes, we could toast the future that is before you that is imminent as part of your process. But I would not rush one moment of your journey. When you are told that it will take a vast amount of what you call time and many many incarnations and great magnitudes of change in your eternal spiritual career, you may erroneously get the idea that you need to hurry up and make advancements. To perhaps check things off your lists so that you can move forward, gain in your rank and bloom as a flower.\nI am here to tell you all this will happen in good time. It is happening in this very hour and it is spectacularly beautiful to behold, the plan that The Father has in store for you unfolding in such a beautiful manner. But do never be discouraged at lack of progress or attainment because you have an eternity to fulfill your desires at attaining and becoming and being and blooming and it will be, it is. I acknowledge all your advancements that have brought you to this place where we can share this process together and I will be quite fond of watching as each one of you pops your bloom at different times and turns to face the sun as you are called.\nIt is magnificent to behold and I am privileged to be in this position.

        "title": "The Unique and Dynamic Nature of Your DNA",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  As you may well know, your scientists have uncovered a great deal about the importance of your DNA and as you may well have concluded there is still a great deal they have yet to discover. This part of your being you have rightly discovered is responsible for imparting to the next generation critical information and therefore when any two individuals mate they are able to each one impart critical information that is necessary to the combination of the new life they create.\nAs you may well imagine, if this tiniest aspect of your being is capable of bringing forward genetic traits it is also capable of bringing forward traits of your lineage and it is this record of your history that is passed down generation to generation. Your scientists have yet to discover the depths of significance in this genetic code that you each have which can be passed forward from you but also has been passed forward to you through many, many generations. And as you well know, genetically this code is altered with each generation.\nThis alteration adds to this genetic code each time and becomes uniquely altered throughout the entire process. Therefore the DNA that you have in you right now is the culmination of a million years of evolution, It contains the genetic memory, if you will, of your lineage and as well carries with it the lineage of divinity. These unused or un-accessed portions of your DNA are nevertheless part of your makeup as they were part of the makeup of all those who came before you who made it possible for you to be here today.\nTherefore your DNA is unique not only to you but to your planet, to your growth as a species and in this way is your pool of DNA on this planet entirely unique to the unfolding of this world. Just as I spoke of different perspectives there are different perspectives and different realities on different worlds. No two have the same history or the same lineage and therefore this pool of the brotherhood of man is unique in this petri dish experiment in time and space.\nYou ask what role Adam and Eve might have to play and I can only tell you that they are eager to play a role. Certainly it is of keen interest to them what happens to this pool of genetic makeup that they too have contributed to. As your text has said, they had grand plans for larger contributions to this genetic pool and their efforts were thwarted but they are still keenly interested in helping with this process of uplifting the gene pool and this speaks to the question of DNA as well.\nYour question also asks whether the DNA you possess or that is currently part of the composition of the brotherhood of man can be changed or altered but I tell you that it is changed and altered routinely and regularly. It may be contributed to throughout this entire process and parts of your DNA that have been dormant may now become activated by frequencies of energy that are being sent out from on high and as you become more enlightened and more aware, this in turn has an impact not only on your DNA in this life but all subsequent DNA will then become the carriers of this new enhanced dimension.\nAnd so it is that this DNA, this scroll of your past becomes changed and altered with each generation and now as we approach the spiritual age, it may in fact be changed within each lifetime. It may be enhanced by the same creative force that you are becoming familiar with as co-creative beings. This is entirely within the realm of possibility, it is even probable as this is consistent with the divine plan of evolution and development and it is this most basic element of yourselves that will contain these new codes and these new awakenings for generations to come.\n",

        "title": "The Role of Gender",
        "Body": "Monjoronson:  I perceive that it is virtually impossible to describe to creatures of gender what it is like to be a creature of non-gender just as it is impossible of complete description to a mortal of time and space what it is like to be free of time and space and infinite in nature. But nevertheless we can make our attempts to reconcile your thought patterns. You have no other paradigm to use for reference so for you there is always part and counterpart in this material realm; plus, minus, male, female, dark and light. Time and space is broken down for you in this way to illustrate contrast and to illustrate necessary combinations of contrast.\nA being of my order is not designed to go through the time/space experience as you are and therefore this lesson in contrast distinction and unity is not part of my required career. I am created by The First Source and Center and as well, you have been created by The First Source and Center through the avenue of the combination of apparently distinct sections you call male and female. There remains throughout your ascension career this facet of part and counterpart, both being required to establish the whole. You refer to your earthly parents and your Divine Parents but the further you go in spirit nature the less this contrast is distinguishable until you have gone all the way back to where there is but One-First Source and Center.\nAnd so it is your destiny to go through this experience and in the end discover the unity that is in the apparent diversity that you are surrounded with in these beginning phases. This is one of the greatest lessons of your eternal universal career and it is impossible as many times as it is said to you, for you to fully grasp the oneness that you are growing towards, the oneness which contains all aspects, the oneness which includes all parts which make up the whole.\nBut for now you operate under this illusion of separateness required to bring about wholeness and this is quite necessary and serviceable to you because there are these different aspects of the whole which are identifiable in this realm as distinctly different and so you start with difference and work towards sameness.\nAs for me personally, I recognize my parents as combined in The First Source and Center. One day you will too. But here and now it is necessary for you to come to terms with the necessity of combining part and counterpart, yin and yang, male and female and as you grow you most certainly will loosen your grip on your definitive declaration of difference.\n(And later during this session....)\n…As I have just commented, you refer to your Divine Parents and you register that you have an essence that is paternal and an essence that is maternal and you register that this pattern holds true even down to your material plane where you register there are maternal and paternal elements to your own life and species. As far as you can see from your perspective you are correct in assessing that there are two distinct aspects required to come together to make life, bring life, support life, nurture life and create some combination, something that was not there before and from your perspective this is an accurate assessment.\nAs I have said, the further you are from your material perspective, the more you may come to realize that these are complimentary elements of the same great creative force and they are simply distinguished by their natures both being mixed together and necessary to instigate this creative process. Beings of my order do not possess a material body as you do. We are created as a result of the intention of The First Source and Center without the element of material combination that you are familiar with and so beings of my order are unlike you in that we not only do not have a gender, but we do not have a body that could have a gender but we may have elements of either the yin or the yang, the part or the counterpart.\nFor beings of your nature this is quite a stretch for you to realize. Your bodies are indeed quite disposable and after you have this body that is quite defined by gender, your next body will be less and less defined in that regard and you will find yourselves becoming more and more of a combined being containing the elements you consider to be at this time opposite each other or part and counterpart. In fact, they are not opposite at all, they are simply aspects of the same and it may take some time before you grow to the realization of this universal truth, being surrounded by a vehicle which is so clearly defined in your terms.\nIt is curious, our different perspectives on this when ultimately we both have the same Creator, the same First Source and Center has willed us into existence and the experience of one of my order is so vastly different from the material time/space experience as to be difficult of description but I appreciate your effort to inquire about these dimensions to further your understanding and awareness. Suffice it to say that your experience with your gender and your body is quite limited to this material time/space dimension and at no other time in your evolution will you be so surrounded by such distinction but rather you will be merging towards the center of what you conceive to be this duality of expression.\nYou have been told that you are not judged or perceived by spiritual beings as male or female but rather all are seen as children of God. It is you who draw such detailed distinctions of things such as gender, race, age, but you are seen from on high all as equally viable developing spiritual beings without reference to any of those qualifying factors which are so all important on your world. I pray you begin to see yourself in this way, as children of The First Source and Center who has created such things as parents who engender different characteristics but combine them to co-create the likes of even you.\nI hope this helps to broaden your perspective some and lift some of your qualifications that you impose upon yourselves, not only for your gender but for your race, your culture, your age, your education level. Your standing before The First Source and Center or God is unfettered by any of these considerations. You are seen for who you are in time and space, a unique divine little first source and center yourself and all these other qualifiers that you surround yourself with are largely inhibitors for you to one degree or another.\nYou are in essence a spiritual being unfettered by any such qualifications if you would only see yourself that way. I hope this provides you with some additional perspective on this question of gender and necessity for such definitions in your life experience.\n",

        "title": "Generational Traits",
        "Body": "Preamble: This questioner states that they recently came across a book relating to people in hospices awaiting their final transition to the morontia life. The subject of generational sin came up, where the idea of which concerned the possibility of a parent to genetically pass on his sins to his progeny or for a son or daughter to carry the same dark energy that one of their parents nurtured during his or her life span.\nQuestion #1:  If this is true, could this explain why children sometimes carry the same vices as their parents and grandparents?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for this question. I must admit, I am uncomfortable with the use of the term sin in context with this question. I might trade that word for traits, as such experiences of one generation may in fact be burned into the DNA record and be passed on as a marker, if you will, in the evolutionary strain that is being compiled by the ancestral lineage. While this popular term of generational sins may carry with it some impact because a judgment is inferred and an attitude is then derived as a result of this judgment in simply even referring to some previous act as a sin.\nSo I would move this questioner more into the realm of pattern or trends or experiences or traits that may be had and passed from one generation to the next. In fact it is impossible to escape this passing on of the experience of life. This may be the best trait of a persons life and as well there will be some of the worst traumas and experiences which are harbored deep in this cellular memory. So the phenomenon is most certainly real and genuine, it is observable as you have said. The attitude towards the phenomenon may stand in need of revision. Things would not necessarily be properly judged as being sin but would most certainly be recognized as aspects or components of an individual's collection. I hope this helps to shed light on the phenomenon and the nature of the phenomenon. Thank you.\nQuestion #2:  Is there any approach you might recommend in particular to break a cycle of negative patterns or traits being passed on so that future generations of the same family tree don't inherit the dark energy that one of the progenitors of this family might have had?\nMonjoronson:  Yes, thank you for this question as it takes the observation of the phenomenon, the next step, into the practical applications of how to deal with it. There are indeed very effective methods for one to change such established and reoccurring patterns and to literally rewrite the new reality into the moment and burn it, so to speak, into the record which will then be passed on to future generations. This is a supreme opportunity that you have and will have as you go through your ascension career and it is done by means of first realizing and coming into the awareness that a pattern exists that you would desire to be relieved of, or that you feel no longer serves your spiritual purpose, or even that you become aware of is a real impediment to your spiritual growth.\nYou have a saying: The first step is to realize there is a problem. This is ever so true and you will inevitably, invariably, repeat patterns over and over again that do not come up for consideration, they simply replay over and over until they come into your consciousness for consideration at some point when you will consider that there may be a problem with the cycle. Then this brings the issue up into the realm for consideration, in fact for re-choosing, or not, this pattern. So the first step is to bring it into your consciousness or awareness and then the next step is to interject your intention.\nYou are not a victim, you are not a passive part of this equation in so far as you will choose not to be. If you do nothing, many times the circumstance or situation will simply trigger a reliable outcome. If you are aware and if you bring your intention into the process, then the same circumstance will bring up for consideration the issue, at which point your intention may direct your choice with calibrated purpose and in so doing you have broken the cycle.\nNow, it will be required of you, that you maintain this new heading and course that you have chosen by matching your further and future decisions and choices to correspond with your new values; in other words, you must maintain the course and heading that you have established, but this is all within your jurisdiction, this is all your opportunity, this is your freewill choice in action. So this question is quite key to changing your individual life, your individual experience and the experience of all those who come after you as you will have modified the pattern, you will have changed the trajectory and all those who come after you will be influenced by the mark that you will leave in your DNA trail. So be about this process with purpose and intention.\nThen arises what do I do with my intention, where do I direct my purpose and how is it that I do something I have never done before and do not know how to do? This is where you have been told to seek the mind of Christ, to ask that Michael's mind co-mingle with yours and in so doing to reorganize your patterns into more divine patterns. Michael is ever ready to get you started with the right heading. If you know not the right heading, there is one who will always help you. There is one within you who will ever be willing to guide you in the right direction. So first, stop and realize; second, bring your conscious choice and choose anew, and third, if you aren't familiar with the direction to go, there is most certainly help to guide you. These steps will forever break the pattern, as you say, and create a new one.\nThank you for this question.\n",

        "Body": "[Attention Deficit Disorder A.D.D. / Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (A.D.H.D.)]\nMary: [Preamble] The diagnosis and treatment of A.D.D. and A.D.H.D. is a very controversial subject in our society. Not only is the diagnosis controversial but the treatment is also controversial. There are rather large numbers of people being diagnosed and treated for this difficulty.\nQuestion #6:  Is there an evolutionary component to this disorder and what do you see as major factors contributing to this disorder?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your concern and your question. It can truly be said that any phenomenon observed in the family of man can be considered to be part of its evolutionary process. It would not be in the equation if it were otherwise. Now, I perceive in your question that you're looking for some defining aspect of this that can be said to be caused by something in particular or in relationship to something specific. Certainly your observation of this phenomenon is necessarily quite limited for your information comes to you from limited sources. There are of course, a number of factors at play in relationship to the phenomenon observed and declared A.D.D.\nThere are lifestyle factors, there are dietary factors, there are chemical imbalances, there are societal pressures and all of these things when inter-associating with each other may bring to the surface certain manifestations much as the manifestations of the common cold are evident in a cough and fever and other such symptoms; so do the manifestations of other disorders come to the surface in other more subtle ways which then must be diagnosed as you said, as a certain condition or ailment or obstacle that impinges on these individuals.\nYour medical world thrives on defining a condition as resulting in a certain number of traits which are either present and evident in various degrees or they are not. If enough of them are present and evident then this becomes labeled as a condition and once having been diagnosed as such the normal medical course is to treat chemical imbalance with chemical influence. In their best attempt they are trying to manipulate the chemical \"soup\" that is present within the individual to bring about desired effects, perhaps less pain, perhaps certain behavioral modification.\nIn all these cases your medical professionals are simply looking at the end of the process. By the time symptoms are manifest, usually the disorder or disease is well advanced and they try to catch up and alter the course of the initial disorder with the use of chemicals. And so they would like to fit all of these disorders into neat little boxes of how they react to neat little chemicals and in this way they feel as though they are able to have some manner of control over the effects that they witness.\nSomething as complicated as A.D.D. cannot be so simply defined as a medical condition or even a psychological condition or even a sociological condition for these are all intertwined to bring about the observed manifestations. You would do well to investigate this issue further and determine for yourself what level of influence may be had by such things as diet or cultural influence or the effects of polluting chemicals on the systems involved. This phenomenon is quite some way from being well defined as to its source points or even as to its treatment. What we do know is that it is part of the human evolutionary process because it is observable phenomenon that is here with us at this time.\nLike all conditions which are comprised of many components there is always an element of spirit which can alter the equation and change the balance and adjust the mix and in this way all conditions are in a state of flux which is part of the folly of declaring someone diagnosed with X, Y, or Z. They are constantly changing and rearranging. Their very cells are being replaced and renewed so this sense of change may be brought into any such equation and utilized to bring positive influence into the equation.\nThank you for this question.\n",

        "title": "Is there a Right Way to Send Good Intentions?",
        "Body": "Question #7:  Mary: This next questioner says that they don't know how to differentiate a communication directed to you or to God, to their angel or to their teacher. It all seems like prayer to them. They ask if that is a good thing or is there something they should be doing differently if they want to contact you directly to offer their services to your mission?\nMonjoronson: Thank you for your question. It is refreshing to receive a question about personal spiritual growth issues. I welcome your observation that when engaged in thinking about other personalities and sending good thoughts and intentions, it all seems to feel like the same thing. It all seems to feel like a prayer because it is all using the same tone or wavelength of gratitude, of sincerity, of purity, of love, of peace, of grace. When you're functioning on this wavelength whether you are petitioning for insight or anything in particular or whether you are sending out your good intentions toward another, it all utilizes this same band of prayerful worship and as such it is not overly important to have great distinction between your focus and perception of individuals or even times or places or circumstances.\nAll these differences are as one when they are brought into this carrier wave of worship and prayer. Oftentimes you may consider that as your question infers, its possible to err in such a process but I tell you plainly that if you are engaged in a prayerful, worshipful state, then your intentions and sincerity and purpose are being well noted and they are being distributed as they may be most beneficial. It is possible to bring some focus to the process and direct your intention towards a specific individual, a specific circumstance and if enough attention is focused in that direction, then it is routinely possible to develop a sort of connection with the individual involved.\nSo while you may consider it useful at times to bring some focus to the process and attempt a specific application of this intention, I would also encourage you that there is no real wrong way to go about it. Everything from a mindless stillness to a focused intention or connection with another are all worthy pursuits in the spiritual realm and all are beneficial to those involved for they bring a dimension of spiritual experience which is also required throughout this ascension career.\n",

        "Body": "This is Monjoronson. (Welcome.) It is a pleasure to be here in this new location, though I occupy many locations during any given day. As I have mentioned before, the Magisterial Mission is multiple. That is, there is the saving grace brought with a Magisterial Mission, which imbues this world with a new spiritual ambience, a receptivity that people, individuals, will feel as they desire to connect with the First Source and Center. It is a privilege to be a Descending Son of that Source, a privilege to be here to learn so much in service to the First Source and Center and to you, individually, and to a world of people.\nI have come here, first, representing the First Source and Center, the Creator, my brother, Christ Michael, and Machiventa your Planetary Prince. When I first came to you as a presence, a benevolence and a Son of what you would call \"magnitude,\" where you would feel my presence, my compassion for you, my care and my love for your lives and your futures. This is one page of a many-paged manual for my Mission. I have stated before as well that I am the Executive of the Magisterial Mission, the Administrator of the Magisterial Staff. My staff is almost complete; the ranks are almost completely filled out with those who will carry out my requests, and co-ordinations with Machiventa and the Most Highs.\nYou have been informed about the coming difficulties of your world; these difficulties are difficulties of mortality, of material existence, living on an over-populated world with diminishing resources. This however, is an opportunity for spiritual enlightenment of your world, a receptivity for the enlightenment by billions of individuals, who are then in transition to their next life, and those who will remain. It is also an opportunity for the . . . the words escape me or seem insufficient to say \"healing, reformation, change, transformation\" and such, for your world, for it is far more than that; it is far greater than any of these words can convey. A paradigm change is adequate, but does not convey the heart energy that this change will create in individuals and in your world, a change of consciousness in your world population, for it will cause a change of race consciousness on your world.\nThis is an opportunity for great, great changes. It is a change—for instance, going from the arithmetic increase, to exponential and logarithmic increase in change in your world. It will require the best minds, the best hearts, the best spirits, the best souls and your greatest wisdoms, to co-ordinate these changes into your personal lives and into your social, political, financial, commercial lives as well. This is why the Most Highs are so readily at hand, and so incredibly involved in the affairs of your world at this time. We work together, and working together does not adequately convey the multi-dimensional interlacing of the Magisterial Mission and the Most Highs, Machiventa and Christ Michael’s overall Correcting Time plan.\n",

        "title": "It All Begins with Choice",
        "Body": "You spoke of procedures and directions and all those are what arise from the choices that you make...\nIt all begins with the choice.\nIt was the choice to pursue spirit, then it was the choice to call this number tonight and it remains true that there are literally thousands of choices that you make every day and most of them you remain completely unaware of your having made. In other words there are a multitude of options present but the human creature tends to revert to habitual patterns most of the times in their lives and having habituated a pattern when a choice does arise, there is no choice activated whatsoever. Rather there is habit that kicks in and automatically the choice has been pre-made for you.\nWhat I am saying is that if you were truly to realize the significance of your choices, you would not waste a single one. You are so potent with your co-creative abilities that what choose literally is. Is there any more powerful force in the universe? Often times we casually throw away these choices, let others decide, go with entropy, decline the offer of engagement and reality happens around us much as we are used to it happening around us. Given the fact that we rarely make any new choices, what is our tomorrow going to be, just like today.\nNo, you all are becoming awakened to the potential of life. Life is choosing moment by moment, attitude, posture, presence. These are chosen moment by moment. When a routine situation arises, where you have a routine response or will you perhaps have a creative response or an inspired response, it's your choice, all your choice. You refer to wanting to work in partnership with a celestial presence such as myself, Monjoronson, and I applaud your decision that that would be a good thing to pursue.\nNow having made that choice that this would be a good and positive direction, what other multitude of choices will we activate to serve our purpose in this regard? If we simply say that would be nice and never choose further to activate this choice, then it will perish as unfostered and unsupported. However if any one of you make a strong choice of conviction and devote your energies and your subsequent choices to supporting that choice, you literally will create the manifestation of that choice. It may come in a variety of forms or in a variety of times but your petition will be answered in that regard.\nYour sincere desires and expressions followed by your choices which then dictate your actions and you have completed the creative circuit. Your thought of what would be a good thing to do, your expression of what would be a good thing to do, your choosing to do that thing and your persistence and dedication to keep re-choosing and redoing that thing will inevitably as a law of the universe manifest that reality.\nQ: That really helps a lot, that's wonderful. Thank you Monjoronson.\nMonjoronson: You are welcome my friend. I appreciate your bringing the topic up. As I said, there are few points that can be stressed with as much significance as this aspect of choosing. Consider how choosing can impact your ability to contact your adjuster. Simply choosing and re-choosing and dedicating yourself to the choice, acting on the choice, manifesting the choice; there is no force of the universe that can stop that from happening. You are co-creative beings and you are exercising your co-creative prerogative. You are choosing and it will be.\n",

        "title": "The Sand Pendulum & The Goal of the Correcting Time",
        "Body": "Through these lessons, we have been striving to assist you to understand the integration of all actions and all decisions in your world, by individuals and by nations themselves. You have an effect on all others, and all others have an effect on you. I would like to describe a sand pendulum that some of you have seen in various places, where a pendulum is suspended from a string over a sand bed, and the pendulum is swung in a way that it swings back and forth, making marks on the sand. It could be a straight lines or it can be orbits.\nThe one design I wish to explain to you is the one of orbits, the one of making a very complex rosette, where there is only one line, but it intersects itself at many points, making a continuous pattern of circles around the sand. Have any of you seen this before? (Several yeses from group.) It is very unique, it is very simple, it is an ancient device, yet it makes exquisite designs in the sand through simple means. The point of this illustration is to let you know that all affects one, and one affects all. Your decisions are all related to all others.\nYour decisions are best made when they are made consciously, in the moment, with intention, with consideration for the consequences, with full knowledge of why you are making them, and how you are making the decision. This may sound rather demanding, but for those who have practiced this way of life, it becomes an every day chore, one of those expectations of excitement for meeting the day with new challenges. The point of this illustration is also to let you know that all this huge effort to heal your planet completely is all related, from global politics, down to the level of your community, the individual and how children are raised. The ends come around to meet the beginnings, and the beginnings eventually become the ends, with many intersections along the way.\nThe goal of the Correcting Time is to affect positive change in the individual. Individuals are the cornerstones of every element of your society. It seems illogical that cornerstones would all be the building, for there would be so many corners, but each of you is a corner of spiritual growth and development of moral decisions of ethical conduct, social responsibility. It is in you that all of these efforts of Christ Michael, the Creator, and all the hierarchy of beings of Christ Michael’s realities, his domain in this local universe, expend their efforts to help you in your life to grow responsibly, to grow in love.\n",

        "title": "The Impact of the Individual on Civilization",
        "Body": "MONJORONSON: I will continue to use the sand stylus as an illustration, though this time the illustration will be a bit different. This time the stylus itself, the pendulum, is the individual and the force of gravity is God. As the individual seeks God, they move in their life, making marks in their civilization by the decisions that they make and in the development of their own potential. So the swing of the stylus, the individual in their life impacts civilization and in the most intimate regions impacts themselves, their soul growth and their determination of their success as an evolving spiritual entity in their infinite life’s course, until they reach Paradise and the embrace with the Creator.\nThese are the criteria for sustainability in the simplest, most stark terms: [a] It is the survival of the individual and the expansion and development of all potential within them to do so; and, [b], the decisions they make, which have an infinitesimal, but measurable and effective result upon their civilization and its sustainability. So you see, the infinite potential of the individual must be explored in a short, very brief lifetime, and it has an impact upon the very finite existence of civilization, which seems infinite to the mortal during their brief lifetime. Civilization seems to be an awesome entity, remote and removed from the individual and their decisions, but yet is finite. So it is a seeming paradox, an irony of sorts, that the finite individual with infinite potential, of infinitesimal power has, in the end, a great effect upon the finite existence of civilization. As the individual seeks God, they move to center, and when that pendulum stops in death, God remains at their center, drawing that individual ever more forward into the adventure of spiritual development in the infinite journey of life, past their former material existence.\nNow, is this illustration of these two criterion reasonably visible to you? (Yes.) Does further explanation need to be given? Anyone?\nStudent: I got the first one, but what was the second one?\nMONJORONSON: The first is the unfoldment, the development of the infinite potential of the individual during their very brief lifetime, and the second one is their effect upon the course of civilization, the sustainability of civilization. As the course of a life swings in its years, and as the individual seeks the center of God—the bottom of the pendulum stroke—they move their life in effective ways to effect civilization’s course and the enfoldment of their infinite potential in this very brief lifetime. That will have an immense effect upon their infinite life’s course in the spiritual realm, and the development of their civilization.\nNever forget that the individual’s decisions and how they live their life do effect your civilization. Yes, there are trends and commonalities among millions and billions of people that do affect a civilization’s course, that it seems that everyone is involved but no one is responsible, but that is an untruth. You, individually, are responsible for the outcome of your civilization, as far as your life can affect it. You are not responsible for the grand outcome of all people upon the course of civilization, but only for your own lifetime. This is measurable. The Unions of Days know this and you will be made aware of this as well. This is not an ominous warning at all, but one to bring you astride of the course of your world, and the course of your life in its journey.\nYou can appraise this more accurately in the afterlife, with your guardian and with your advisors, to see how you are doing, how you are contributing to the fulfillment of the Grand Universe. This may seem awesome, a ponderous chore, but everything is recorded, everything is measurable, and you can always be informed about your status in the universe. During this lifetime, especially on this planet, it is a \"guessing game\" for you; you must go within, trust your relationship with the Father fragment, the Creator within you and \"will to will God’s will be done in your life\" and know that it will be expressed as you let it. Be willing to risk the adventure of your life, similar as we discussed about risking to allow your children to explore the adventure of their lives, with guidance, provision for exploration, for the development of their erupting and evolving potential within them. So, too, you will parent and husband your own life, caring for it much as a shepherd cares for its flock of individual sheep.\n",

        "title": "Making Meaningful Contributions to Your Civilization",
        "Body": "Now let us take this pendulum and let it swing wide, for it is in the expression of your individual lives that your civilizations will live or die. First, you cannot make a meaningful contribution to your civilization if you are not aware that you do—consciously, that is. Many people contribute to their civilization by the good decisions that they make. They know that they are responsible for the decisions and that their decisions have an effect on others. Some even intuit that their lives have an affect upon civilization, but few realize and understand that their decisions affect when your world enters into the era of the days of light and life. A world coming into the days of light and life is not done by happenstance, my friends. The over-care of your world is immense so that it, too, comes into the era of the days of light and life! On those planets that have a normal progression of development, this plan is done diligently, carefully, faithfully, by the spiritual guardians of that planet who are responsible. Individuals are taught how to live a life that sustains their existence—but more importantly, that it grows. It is not sufficient to simply sustain your life, but it must grow in order that your civilizations be sustained and evolve.\nYour world has had a tumultuous existence. Until very recently, it lacked the day-to-day and millennium-to-millennium over-care management along with the cluster of worlds to which your world belongs. Now, the Correcting Time is in place to assist your world, and you individually, to do that. And I am here with you urging you to make responsible decisions that contribute to your life, your children’s lives, as well as your family, community, nation, civilization, and your world.\nThis rosette of life connects the individual with their own children, their parents, grandparents, community, and all the agencies outside that assist you, whether it is schools, churches, a neighbor family, community, the library. How do all of these factors of life assist in sustaining the individual? Is to make decisions and take actions that contribute to sustaining your life and your children, in your world. That is it! Conscious living: living in the now, with an appreciation for using it as an individual and for your world.\nI will give you a very brief example, which hits home to you right now: Will you go out and buy an $80,000 SUV that gets 12 miles to the gallon, or will you buy an equally capable car that gets 50 miles to the gallon and costs $25,000? We want you to ponder that; I am not going to give you the answer to that today. (Laughter. A bit obvious!) We hope it is obvious! Does this help sustain you as an individual? How does it detract? Which decisions help sustain you better? It is not a \"good or bad\" decision; it is which contributes more meaningfully to your existence, to your sustainability, and to your world. These issues are all related.\nWe have seen so many of you who are sad—deeply sad. Your philosophers would say you are existentially sad. You live life going to work, coming home, spending money, surviving. You are not sustaining yourself; you are simply surviving, until you die. This is very sad; you have lost purpose; you have lost the way of discovering meaning in your life. Some of you work long hours and come home bone tired; you eat dinner and go to bed and tomorrow you wake up and do the same thing. Life is brutish when it is that way; life is short and mean, as some of your writers have said, and truly it is. There must be time for leisure. There must be time for rest, for there is no spiritual growth or development without rest or leisure. You need not feel guilty about taking time for rest or leisure, to walk down to the park and sit and watch the leaves fall off the tree, or in springtime to watch day-by-day and see the daffodils and the crocus come up through the ground and come into flower, and you take joy in that. When there is opportunity, we do urge you to refresh yourself, to take time apart, to be with yourself, for only when you are in that state can you then go within and be with the essence of God within you, and to wonder and to explore your spiritual potential. Those are issues that sustain you, as a soul. You must make decisions as adults that are as meaningful as those, which you contribute to the lives of your children and grandchildren. Your guardian can urge you; your Mystery Monitor, the Father fragment within you, can urge you, but you must grasp that urging and make a decision and take some action.\nThose of you who are slothful, those of you who live unproductive lives, lives without work, without meaning, without purpose—this is as detrimental to your soul growth as those who work too hard, those who are absent from life due to the obligations of life, the obligations of living. We urge you never to retire from life, never to take a respite from your growth, your relationship with the Father within. Never take a hiatus from the journey, the path of your spiritual growth in life. Know that it is intimate, available to you at all times. We urge you to continue to be an active part in the rosette of life with others, to be contributing members of your society and your families, your children and grandchildren—and your neighbors’ children and grandchildren. Do not be afraid to be friendly to those who live next door.\n",

        "title": "The Overpopulation of Our Planet",
        "Body": "Student: I have a question. It says in the Urantia Book that the man to land ratio is key to the well being of the human race. Is our population in line with the man to land ratio? They predict that there will be nine billion people by 2050. Are you able to speak on that, or how do we keep our population within limits?\nMONJORONSON: This is not a function that is governable by individuals, or even by societies or nations, except that individuals may responsibly raise a reasonable number of children, so that they are cared for, educated and prepared for their future. The population of your world is grossly out of balance. It will be at that time, which you state, approximately three times larger than it should be. There is truly an equation for the number of people that can successfully, productively, rationally, spiritually, occupy land in relationship to the square mileage or land mass.\nYour other question obviously must be, \"How will this be aligned?\" We will not institute any global program of eugenics. This situation of over-population of your planet will be self-rectifying. It is unavoidable; it is now in preparation, we are aware that there are forces in your world, which will change the population level dramatically in a very brief period of time. We work with all individuals; we work with all souls. We wish that the production of healthy, whole, heavy souls occur on every planet, and that every soul that leaves this planet be weighty with wisdom, experience, understanding, insight, and personal reverence. You make them by moral and ethical decisions; you make heavy souls with the addition of service—not required, obligatory service, but joyful service, generous service, gleeful service, service that is done from the heart.\nLook about you in your world. How many people serve easily, generously, passionately? How many people are making good moral, ethical decisions, given that they are presented to them every day? Many souls leave your planet light as a feather, with very little survival capacity. Yet, many of you leave this planet as heavy souls, having made many weighty, consistent, good, ethical, and moral decisions and have provided wonderful service to your fellow brothers and sisters.\nThe opportunity for decision-making is before everyone. The opportunity for service is before everyone. The awakening of the Thought Adjuster, the awakening of the individual and the connection with the Thought Adjuster, the Father fragment, is essential to the growth of the soul. You here are heavy souls; you are weighty with good decisions and wonderful service. You will survive, if you wish to. This, too, is a decision; this too is part of an intention for living. These are decisions that you must make, consciously—not flippantly or errantly, but consciously with good intention. What I am saying in answer to your question is that we appreciate the number of souls that are on your planet, yet we know clearly that many will leave here deciding not to continue the journey. Many will leave here having no idea of what their life was about, and many will be leaving here who have great value.\nThis scythe that will cut across the populations of your world, is no respecter of status, power, authority, monies, or spiritual development—it will strike evenly to everyone. And it will reduce the population of your planet: it is unavoidable; it is inevitable; it will occur. And when you do cross, whether before or after this occurs, we are there, we are so close to you. We will help you make this transition more easily.\n",

        "title": "War, Peace and the Polarization of Your Thought Processes",
        "Body": "MONJORONSON: ..The difficulty that you humans have in receiving information is that your beliefs form structures in your thinking, and when you become attached to these beliefs, it is very difficult for new ideas to blend in: how does this relate? Because you have such polarization in your thought processes—it must be one idea or the other. I say you to that more often than not it is a combination of ideas that yield the greatest picture of truth.\nIt is particularly challenging for the Urantian mind to be able to contain these two divergent thoughts at the same time, seeking to polarize rather than to unify. This is all part of the culture that has grown up from the planetary rebellion to keep you in strife, to keep you in contention instead of into the energies of harmonization that blend you together; not only with one another but with ideas. Does this help?\nStudent: Very much so. ..Is that massive catastrophe to whatever degree it may happen really the final playing out of these notions of strife and warfare in the Luciferic culture?\nMONJORONSON: My answer is yes and no, for the culture of war is something different evolutionary animalistic tendencies to fight. There has been a heightened developed purposeful culture of war that has been cultivated here very carefully. It is to say that the evolutionary tendency for war has been magnified many, many, many times so that now you have this culture of war whereas the plans of Michael are to develop a culture of peace and harmony.\nSo there is this polarization occurring for the yearning of peace in the hearts of individuals of this planet is growing, and it is coming into direct opposition with the culture of war. But it will take many years for the evolutionary potentials of peace to grow. There is a time coming when people will want to choose peace over war, and how that will actually play out in your planetary history is still yet to be determined. The time is coming when more people will rise up and choose peace. You saw what happened in a short period of time when the human heart wanted to choose freedom. You saw this happen over in the Soviet Union and those Eastern European blocks where within a very short period of time the wall of repression was torn down. Choose peace, my brethren. Ask for the ways of peace to be implanted in the human heart, for those ideas of peace to be magnified within the human mind. This is how you can help this effort. Will there be a final Armageddon? That is up to you. Do we wish this? No, we do not. But you must decide how you will respond to this growing polarity between the old guard still wanting to cling onto the ways of control and repression and the yearning of the human heart for peace, harmony and freedom. Do you understand, my brother? (Yes, thank you so much.) Are there any other questions before I take my leave?\nStudent: You said the old guard. As the old guard goes, what is the new…it’s not a guard, what would the new be?\nMONJORONSON: The new family—the family of humanity, the family of the universe. You are coming into a greater appreciation that life is more expansive than what you had previously conceived. The old guard was doing just that—it was guarding old ideas. The new family is the reawakening within the human heart to live in peace, to live in harmony, to live in love, to live in compassion. This is quite a large change. Some of you have not fully yet embraced this idea of what this does truly mean on Urantia. I am referring mostly to your brothers and sisters who can hardly conceive of what life would be when there is no more strife and struggle with one another. Truly this will be an age unlike anything has ever been seen on Urantia. It must be birthed in order for you to develop and evolve into Light and Life.\n",

        "Body": "Your new era will only be sustainable if you have in place philosophies, perspectives, and public policies that support the existence and development of great potential in individuals. The new era will be de-populated, as we have discussed, before. People who remain are not \"special,\" were not \"picked,\" they simply remain—it will be a cross-section of your world’s population, and they will be all that remains to bring about, to bring into existence, the days of light and life. Only sustainable policies, philosophies, and applications at the individual level will do that. You must think in terms of sustainable lifestyles, sustainable economies, sustainable educations that provide educational training and technical basis for sustainable community societies that also, as well, provide fulfillment for the individual at their level of capacity and development.\nRemember, there are soulful people who have less intelligence than you. There are individuals who are surely beloved by God, as much as you. There are those who are lesser intellectually endowed, but who are loved as much and cared for as much by the Creator, by Christ Michael, as you are, and those who are far brighter than you are. It is not a matter of intelligence, my friends. It is a matter of soul value. The lessons and wisdoms [sic] that these people collect may be few, but they are equally as valuable as yours. When all is said and done in the resurrection halls on the mansion worlds, you will see that they generally bring forth a humility that is innate in their own being, that some of you have yet to learn.\nSo, where does that lead us? Where does that lead you? Where do you stand? Where do you voice your opinions? The months and years are not far off when you must come forward, my friends. You must speak because the question of survivability will be in front of you, will be in front of everyone. The beginning of the New Era will be an opportunity to reinvent your societies. You will be asked to reinvent your communities, and you will ask yourselves, \"How can I—how can you—reinvent our families?\" Today you must ask yourself, \"How can I reinvent myself to become sustainable, to become loved\"—that is loved as a functional part of the universe, integral with the harmony of vibration of sustainability, which is integral, inherent and pervasive in all the universe. First of all, I would ask you to be at peace with yourself.\nShed fears that are not real, remove ego needs that require satisfaction for yourself, and live simply. Doing that, you will come to love others, as you love yourself.\n",

        "title": "How We Help to Sustain You",
        "Body": "How do we devise sustainability with you? One body of spiritual elders are called \" the Most Highs,\" which are mentioned in the Bible—the Old Testament—and by other agencies that assist your world in the affairs of humankind, mankind, on a global scale. They work with the larger social and political elements of your world—the economic, commercial, industrial, communications, governmental, regulatory associations of a global nature. These are places where decisions are made by groups, which must be guided by an overseer-ship of a spiritual nature. On the level of the individual, however, each of you has within you a Divine Spark that guides you in your decisions. Some historically have called this their \"conscience,\" but it is not your conscience. It is an actual living spiritual energetic entity of the Divine that rests in you.\n..I refresh you in that memory of your world where there have been many attempts to assist you in your world, to form positive unions, to form positive associations to help you grow. The avatars, the great teachers in this century, last century, and past centuries—all have been guided by a tremendous inner knowing, a center that they wished to expand to include all others on their planet, your planet. I am here to assist that too.\n..You have seen many wondrous things in your world; you of this sub-culture of your world who understand \"coincidences.\" You understand the serendipity of time, event, places, the coincidence of like-minded individuals coming together. You are part of a mind-set, a global, cosmic mind-set that has a \"oneness.\" This, my friends, is sustainable. It is sustainable by the belief that it exists, that these incidents of coincidence, serendipity are real, and that the universe is a friendly place that assists you to put the pieces together. You do not know how or why, or understand the mechanism of this, and you need not know—you simply need only believe that it exists, that it is good, that it is benevolent and that you are a part of it, and that your life, as this exists, is sustainable. This will not be taken away from you, unless you give it up. You are sustainable in your belief system, and you will grow.\nYou are evolving. There is the means on the planet now with the reconnection of the spiritual circuits, for each of you to evolve to much higher levels. \"Higher\" is not really the correct word to use, but more evolved levels of your spiritual development, even while as material mortals. It is your mind mechanism that is necessary to do this. Your capacity to feed the benevolent connection that you have with the universe, you can invite that connection into your life in a living, real way. You are part of the sustainable light in this world that is growing. Some of you can see this, and clearly you can. Some of you know that it exists and you feel it around you. Some of you accept it in faith, without evidence, without knowing, without feeling, without seeing—but you know it exists, and you are part of this. This is sustainable. This will not be lost. This effort of healing on your world, or of bringing light onto your world, will not stop or cease—it is sustainable. You are the elements that sustain it.\nYou have seen this product, a flashlight that you shake and shake and shake, and then you turn the light on and it works. Soon it will run down and then you shake and shake and shake it and it lights up again. You are the hand that shakes the light! (Much laughter.) You sustain the light. Do you understand that? You sustain the light. Your actions, your decisions to shake the light, to make the light real, makes it grow: you know it is real; we know it is real. You help us help it grow. Your decisions help it grow. Our efforts to assist you with coincidence and serendipity, to bring you into association with others who think similarly, is our effort to make the light brighter in your world. We wish that this would eventually make your planet, your globe, glow in time and space, as it revolves around your sun, as we see it in the universe.\nYou are the sustaining elements of your new world, in this new era. You have made that decision; you have been participating, you have assisted in many ways. Many of you are assisting your world to sustain itself as a physical planet, to renew the resources that you have, and to be guardians of the resources that exist and are diminishing. You are wise and careful recipients and servants of the good that you receive in the material realm. You also do the same socially, through your social decisions to be socially responsible, to assist and \"be\" the elements of light in daycare centers and families, to be worthy, competent, capable mothers and fathers, rather than absentee parents. You can be a good and wise parent even though you have latchkey children, children who come home from school and wait for you until you come home from work. It is not the quantity of life that you have, but the quality of life that you share with deep abiding love.\n",

        "title": "The United Nations & A New Enterprise for Nations",
        "Body": "Student: Monjoronson, is the United Nations worth saving, or is it better if we just start from scratch and develop something new to work with all the nations together for peace?\nMONJORONSON: I hear three questions and the answer is yes, yes and yes. That is not facetious at all, but yes, your United Nations is worth saving. Yes it is worth being replaced. And yes, it will be replaced, and there will be a new enterprise of nations. Your world will come into an era before long, similar to that of an individual who is in immense crisis. It is as though your world is a cul-de-sac of houses, people living close by, each living unto their own, going their own way every day. Yes, caring somewhat for their neighbors, but individually doing what they please, with the resources they have, when they wish. And yes, there are times when an occupant of one house will become greatly ill, or have a traumatic divorce, loss of finances, loss of employment, and everything goes to smash in their life. And it is a journey for individuals; your world is in a journey.\nThere is such self-serving centeredness, even the causing of fear in neighbors for self-advantage, among your nations. There must occur a joining together for survival, to overcome their boundaries, a willingness to share sovereignty, a willingness to co-create together to overcome common difficulties. Boundaries and borders will cause the demise of whole nations. Those who survive will share resources, will share capabilities, will share talents. Working together will be necessary for your whole survival—holistic survival—it is not a play on words. Nations must not only realign themselves —that would give the wrong impression—they must coalesce; they must willingly share a oneness on new levels, in new ways. Already, you are seeing the beginnings of this through the European countries. Already you are seeing this in these two western continents where water knows no boundaries, it flows from one nation to another; electricity is developed in one nation and transported over power lines to another, and sold. Nations agree to this. Why cannot they agree to many other things, as well?\nSovereignty will be a major issue that your nations will work with. If I may use your question to expand and expound upon, this issue of sovereignty, I will. Sovereignty is one of those huge, huge global issues that must be resolved. Not ignored, but consciously and carefully dissolved. We are not talking immediately of having one world government, one voting system, or anything similar to that, but simply the tearing down of non-essential walls of sovereignty. This will begin through the dissolution or diminishment of your military forces, those bodies that act to reinforce, to hold boundaries and sovereignty together.\nThe \"me-ism\" of your world must give way to the \"we,\" to the \"us,\" to the \"and,\" rather than the \"but,\" and \"except.\" As leaders in your world—yes, even you—you are leaders; you have much to offer; you have much to give. Your ideas are valuable. Someone must speak up! There are no leaders without followers, competent, capable followers. You are needed; you are needed to speak up. There will be a time to speak up, and my friends, you can rest assured that your Guardian Angel, your Celestial Teacher will nudge you to speak up. You will become aware of this inner urging, the necessity of speaking up. What you have to share will be needed, even when you speak of national sovereignty. Some of the problems and difficulties that will evolve will come upon your people rapidly, without anticipation. The issue of sovereignty will be one of them.\n",

Think of this word: ONENESS—what does this mean? It is the ONENESS that you share with your Paradise Father. It is the language that love builds a new reality into your being. Seek this word; allow it to encode within you and it will build these ideas of harmony, fraternity, compassion, tolerance within your being and bring into the awakened human heart the desire for family relationship.\nYour families are undergoing great change in your culture. You know from your Urantia text the importance of family—a true family headed by a loving mother and father who raise children to be conscious of their Divine Source and their relationship with one another. So the seeds are planted and now it is time for you all to water them through your stillness and ask for these new languages of love, forgiveness and harmony to be built within you and to take that out into your daily lives and show that you are indeed living what you are receiving.\n",

        "title": "Child Rearing: A Fundemental Component to Sustainable Civilization.",
        "Body": "Child rearing is fundamental to a sustainable family, a sustainable community, sustainable nation, and a sustainable civilization in the world. Similarly as justice and injustice offer insights to a nation’s degrees of evolution and development, a nation’s maturity can as well be determined by the state of its prisoners, so too can the future of those organizations, families, communities, states, nations, civilizations be foretold through the child rearing practices that are in place.\nAlmost in no place in your world are there large populations where child rearing practices suggest or lead to sustainable communities. A nation that is socially stable provides the technological and material supports necessary to raise children to become adequate individuals. But do they thrive? If I were to give your political candidates a slogan to use, it would be to, \"thrive and survive.\" And, to do that there must be a foundation of public policies that promote a sustainable environment. There must be a foundation of child rearing practices and philosophies in place and in practice in a majority of families in a nation in order for a nation to be sustained. These then connect all other sustainable practices, public policies, and social philosophies.\nIt is from this perspective of child rearing that all else is related—justice, governance, police coverage, education—all evolve out of your child rearing practices. The question that you must ask every one, at every level of organization, is how do these policies, how do the intentions, how do the functions of this organization support the rearing of children, so they can become sustainable individuals on their own?\nThere must be a way of examining your public policies, family policies, philosophies and religious education, that points back to some source, so your civilizations become sustainable. Yes, even your religions must contribute to this. This is a way of testing religious doctrine: How do they contribute to the individual, and the individual’s survival as a soul in the universe? Surely, fear and guilt have nothing to do with sustainable lives, the growth of souls, the increase of a soul’s weight and value after death.\nThe maintenance of nations is maintained—or not—through its practices of sustaining its citizenry. Citizenry is sustained by its practices and philosophies that are applicable to raising children to become loving, peaceful, contributing, constructive individuals in a society. Pluck any individual out of a society or culture, a community or a family, and you can examine the state of your nation and your world. You know that peace is the measure of a world’s civilization. Where there is peace, there is civilized conduct. Where there is sustainable peace, there is the advancement of society and the progress of civilization.\nWhat practices evolve and develop to contribute to the development and sustainable aspects of a child? Moreover, as importantly—equally important—how do all the policies and philosophies support the sustaining power of a family to raise these children? If your technologies do not contribute to that, then they must be discarded, amended, or adapted so they do. When you examine your civilization with this touchstone, you will see how much and how immature your world truly is. You will see, you will measure, you will come to know with certainty that your nation may be a materially and technologically advanced, but morally, ethically, socially, familially, and individually, very retarded.\n",

        "title": "Parents are the Hope for the Future",
        "Body": "MONJORONSON: The most highly detrimental aspect towards the development and unlocking the potential of children are their parents. Yet, the parents are the most responsible individuals to do so. The parents are the hope of the future. Many have said in your society that the children are the hope of the future—we beg to differ. It is the parents who are the hope for the future. Where parents neglect, the children will not be raised well, and it must then come from within the child to resurrect the adult in themselves to see the way and follow that way.\nThere are individuals who are raised in dire, despicable, disastrous family situations, who nonetheless come out and become exemplary to their society— wonderfully full souls, who have made a great service of their lives, by the moral and ethical decisions that they have made. Factors of neglect that parents provide weigh immensely on the outcomes of these young individuals. Any inclinations of separation between the parent and the child are significant. There must be seen an integration and continuity of the adult in the child and the child in the adult, that one becomes the other. When parents fail to see this continuity, and see themselves as separate and see themselves as being burdened by their children, then children will not be able to unlock the potential that is within them, no matter what schools they go to, no matter what cultural resources are provided.\nParents must assist the unlocking of the heart energy, the heart-line, in addition to the mind-line of these children. There is a presence within the parent that must touch the presence of the child. It is important to look within the child in love, through their eyes, and the child through your eyes, in love, to make a connection of souls. Truly, this is the place of connection. The responsibility of parents is onerous and ominous and incredibly large, yet it is a place of tender giving and receiving, a place where love can be taught. Family is the primary socializing institution in your society, any society—an essential place where children are raised. Loving parents alone—as single parents can do this, but it is inadequate to fulfill the roles the children must learn, and the models that they need to be complete in their adulthood. They need both models to unlock the potential within them, for there are many roles to be played out in their mind through these models they learn as they play, grow, and work.\n..It is responsible of individuals who become procreative parents, to bring their children into existence as responsibly and as lovingly and with similar intentions as our Father God has brought the universe and you into existence. Care has been made for your existence; care has been made for your arrival.\n..It is heart-breaking to us—to use your phrase—to see these issues come into existence— to see children, whether they are teenagers or whether they are in their 20’s, 30’s or 40’s, having children and do not have the capacity to raise them responsibly, or even care for them physically. Where is the harmony there? There is none. Where is the order? Where is the pattern? It is gone.\n.. Our work in the Correcting Time is to bring pattern, order and good models into existence. Each one of you was anticipated on Divinington. Each one of you is loved, appreciated, accepted. Each of you has a purpose, a meaningful life, a life-plan for existence, part of which you can accept as becoming parents. When you have children, raise them with the same dedication, fervor, interest, and presence, as Christ Michael brought this world into existence, and then provided a loving model as Jesus, in the presence of others. Raise them with this love; raise them with harmony so they have integration and oneness within their being.\nHow can you assist children to raise children responsibly, when they become adults? It is necessary for a maturing society to instill in its members the belief that they are responsible for their children and who they become...and to raise only the number of children that you can do so responsibly, carefully, with dedication and commitment. How many would that be? Perhaps you have the capacity to raise four children into adulthood, to become responsible, capable, and spiritual enlivened individuals. Perhaps it is only one. Perhaps you do not love yourself enough to even raise one. Becoming a responsible parent begins by providing a responsible model for your own children. You must give your children the beliefs and model to follow, so that they will be able to make a responsible decision to have children or not, and to raise their own children responsibly if they choose to have children.\nApplying eugenics is not necessary when individuals understand the responsibility of having children. They will practice what is necessary to bring children into existence. That may be abstinence; it may be for them to be birth control—whatever is necessary to bring responsible, loving individuals into your world, is what is needed. The responsibilities of procreation are not taught or enforced well on our planet. There is such a huge backlog of social issues on your world; it can only begin with the individual. That is why parenting, and raising children responsibly is so important to the Correcting Time, to the Magisterial Mission, and to Christ Michael now, and as Jesus when he lived it here on your planet.\nThere is no way through the problems you describe, other than through the example of one person at a time. The societies of this world are so bereft and so incapable and incompetent to raise and educate individuals in how to be responsible, procreative parents that it will take many generations to correct this problem. Yes, there are some outstanding examples, but there are so few to point to.\n",

        "title": "The Adventure of Raising Children in the New Era",
        "Body": "You are each unique, and each has unique answers and solutions to your life’s course. This is what makes your life an adventure; this is what makes having a family an adventure, raising children an adventure. How do you possibly raise a child to become all it can become, expressing all its inner potential, at its greatest possibility, when you are totally in control? You cannot. You absolutely cannot. You have to be fearless to let them go, fearless to let them explore, offering them every opportunity to explore, safely, without injury to themselves, and without injury to others. Those are truly, your only limitations.\nThis lesson and the lessons that follow are doubly, trebly, and quadruply important, in view of the fact that you are in the generation of \"new\" children coming to your world. There are children of the new era arriving now, children who have arrived decades ago, who are similar to you but of greater potential. They have a greater depth of potential expression, a greater depth of resources that is innate in their being; these are coming into your world now.\nMany of you have recognized that there are many children who are not the same as the children that you were, the children that you raised, or your grandchildren, but there are children among you now, who are extraordinary! How can they produce extraordinary results if they are allowed and afforded the opportunity and the resources to explore their potentials? They can only do that through you—procreative parents and protective and resourceful, generous grandparents, who encourage their children and grandchildren to explore avenues of expression and development, which may not seem typical to \"let the brain loose,\" so that they can run free to explore, again without injury to themselves or injury to others.\nThis is the foundation for all that will come in the new era. Your new era will only be sustainable if you have in place philosophies, perspectives, and public policies that support the existence and development of great potential in individuals. The new era will be de-populated, as we have discussed, before. People who remain are not \"special,\" were not \"picked,\" they simply remain—it will be a cross-section of your world’s population, and they will be all that remains to bring about, to bring into existence, the days of light and life. Only sustainable policies, philosophies, and applications at the individual level will do that. You must think in terms of sustainable lifestyles, sustainable economies, sustainable educations that provide educational training and technical basis for sustainable community societies that also, as well, provide fulfillment for the individual at their level of capacity and development.\nRemember, there are soulful people who have less intelligence than you. There are individuals who are surely beloved by God, as much as you. There are those who are lesser intellectually endowed, but who are loved as much and cared for as much by the Creator, by Christ Michael, as you are, and those who are far brighter than you are. It is not a matter of intelligence, my friends. It is a matter of soul value. The lessons and wisdoms [sic] that these people collect may be few, but they are equally as valuable as yours. When all is said and done in the resurrection halls on the mansion worlds, you will see that they generally bring forth a humility that is innate in their own being, that some of you have yet to learn.\nSo, where does that lead us? Where does that lead you? Where do you stand? Where do you voice your opinions? The months and years are not far off when you must come forward, my friends. You must speak because the question of survivability will be in front of you, will be in front of everyone. The beginning of the New Era will be an opportunity to reinvent your societies. You will be asked to reinvent your communities, and you will ask yourselves, \"How can I—how can you—reinvent our families?\"\n",

        "title": "There is Beauty in Every Stage of Development",
        "Body": "Q: I will make an analogy. This unawareness of spirit that we have as a child, through willful desire and focused intention leads to awareness of this spirit. We find ourselves downloading from our Father fragment and unseen friends, divine parents. As this communication occurs, we then become able to commune through awareness of being spiritually empowered. Thus the engagement process or uploading. In finding that we are indeed creatively contributing as powerful architects of our destiny and our planets as well as the co-creation of the evolving Supreme Being of the grand universe, much like a respiration process. Is this a healthy analogy?\nMonjoronson: As participants and fellow co-creators in the process you are in fact engaged in the process of sharing both ways, as you say the download and the upload, this is your contribution to the Supreme indeed as well as the Supremes contribution to you. You are raising your awareness level and this is directly beneficial to the Supreme as well as personally beneficial to you. This is as well a cyclical process that you engage and then release as your energy to be engaged rises and wanes and throughout this entire growth process it is important to remember you are exactly where you are supposed to be.\nYou should never attempt to compare yourself with another's journey and their progress or your culture or your civilization or your family of humans. You are a unique individual and while humans are disposed to register themselves in relation to and in contrast to their peers, each one is in fact a cherished and loved individual who is in fact making their unique contribution to the Supreme exactly as they should in the process. Much like in a family, the youngest is not held accountable for not being on the same level as the oldest and yet each are equally loved by the parents for being exactly where they are.\nSo it is with you as individuals. Some have made certain achievements and advancements, others are in a different cycle in the process, all are loved by the Supreme Father of all. There is beauty in every stage of growth and development. As any parent will attest, there is a certain beauty to the innocence of the very young child that the parent reminisces about once the child has left that stage. There is another beauty as they unfold who they are and yet there is even another beauty as they become fully matured and can be the person that they were growing the whole time.\nBut each stage is to be cherished. Each stage is but a short passage. Enjoy every turn in the road, every bend in the river of your journey because it is a short passage and one that you are experiencing as a contribution to the Supreme. Therefore we should not hurry about the process, we should not circumvent any part of this journey because that is our contribution to the Supreme, to be in that moment, to experience that distinction, to cherish that stage of evolution. Rejoice, wherever you find yourselves rejoice. Wherever you find your brothers and sisters rejoice. It is a once in an eternity experience.\nSavor each moment and yet that is not to say we do not look forward to what is before us and what the future holds and all the grand potentials. Just as the parent looks forward to the child becoming mature and accessing all the potential of a mature being.\n..I would once again extend my gratitude for such an opportunity as you have all provided, as you all have created and I would bid you all a bountiful journey, full and rich with experience and expectation and joy at what is before you for in fact you are well departed on your journey back to the First Source and Center and this represents a miracle that you have chosen to do such at this stage of your development. You are as the small children who are graced by your efforts with understanding beyond your time and I cherish the opportunity to work with such individuals as yourselves.\n",

        "Body": "Question: Could you enlighten us a bit more about our state of consciousness before we are born on this world?\nMonjoronson: I would like to satisfy your curiosity about this as your Urantia Book has left you somewhat in the dark. There have been reasons for this at the time of the transmission. As for the importance of this information to be made known to you, it is not quite there yet. However, so many on Urantia have some awareness or some vague belief about having existed before birth in this state of physicalness that I am allowed now to affirm this idea in generality, not in specifics. The idea that you existed, your soul and personality existed, before this physical life is correct. Some of the ideas attached to this thought are quite hazy or erroneous, inaccurate.\nAt this time we will not yet be giving specifics to this question, but I can tell you that you did have foreknowledge and choice of where you were going, meaning this planet at the time that you chose to be born, approximately. You had some latitude of choice for the details of your family, your life, but much was not known to you as far as how the details of your life would be played out. You came where and when you did for specific reasons of the experiences that you agreed with others who counseled you, what you needed next. So it was in a sense, \"read\" how you might accomplish gaining these experiences and encountering the precursors that would lead into the lessons that you needed for this part of your journey. It is never guaranteed that it will be accomplished in this one lifetime setting.\nI caution you about jumping from this to the conclusion that you have multiple physical lifetimes on this same planet. As I began to state, there is no guarantee that things will work out the way you plan or hope. There is always free will, and there is always grace and mercy in the Father’s plan. There is always room for the unexpected\n",

        "title": "The Moment of Conception",
        "Body": "Monjoronson: Each of you here had a moment of conception, where two cells came together to form one whole cell. That moment of conception was known before it occurred. Your Thought Adjuster knew of this event. The records of your coming existence reflect that your material existence was known in Divinington before you came into existence. You were wanted, are wanted, and are needed. There is a place for you in the Grand Universe in the \"mansions\" that Jesus spoke about in God’s Heaven—in simple terms. Some of you have been parents, procreative individuals who brought another into existence. Some conceptions occur spontaneously, and some with forethought, none-the-less, your existence was anticipated before conception.\nWe are pleased with the growing awareness of the living substance that exists in the bodies of parents-to-be, before conception occurs, that people prepare for this conceptive moment by cleansing their bodies, by eating well, not indulging in toxic substances so that their progeny come into existence cleanly, wholly, free of poisons, free of damage. You have enough damage and fragmentation in your genetic code as it exists, without contributing more to a child’s difficulties as a living being.\nAnd here again, we are talking about the sustainable individual as a biologic individual, a material individual. The substances that you ingest into your body beforehand, do affect the zygote, the embryo, fetus, child, infant, young-adult, the adult and then the procreative individual. The decisions that parents-to-be make ahead of time do effect the living course of the children, to be intellectually endowed, spiritually endowed, artistically endowed, ahead of time. This allows for the greatest potential of the individual to bloom and come to the fore, during their developmental years. So here in the continuous sustainability, we are speaking about parents-to-be. This union occurs when two cells begin the journey of biologic development, which will not be complete until the individual’s 20s and 30s, time when there is preparation for begetting new children.\nWhat we are praising is the forethought of procreative parents to consider the welfare of their children that will come into existence, to prepare this life for its fulfillment. And yes, shortly after conception occurs, more thought is given by the mother to consider her diet, the foods she eats and how these foods are prepared, the medications that she takes and the other substances that she may ingest into her body, for whatever is taken in by the mother is shared with the child. You know this, of course. Many of you are very aware of this and you take many precautions so that your child who comes into physical form unto its own, nine months later, is whole and well, healthy and mentally alert. All the potentials within their unfolding genetic code in the next few months and years, continues to enfold to allow the greatest potential.\nYou note, please, that I continue to speak of potential, for each of you has immense potential. Even now, you oldsters have great potential you have never explored. Even now, you can explore this and enfold it, develop it into magnificent states of existence and being and development of your talents, in mind, body and in your soul. This is ongoing. Therefore, we would hope even in later years, you would hold the excitement of enfoldment of what lies within you, rather than the complacent acceptance of your demise. Do not be willing my friends, to go down easily into the dust, but do so with an eagerness to explore who you are, until that time. For you have an evolving relationship with the Father fragment within you, the Creator of the universe—this is intimate; this never ends!

        "title": "The Months of Gestation and The Time Following Birth",
        "Body": "Monjoronson: During the 9 months of gestation, there are many influences upon the child, this soul-in-the-making. You want to do everything you possibly can to assist in the full development of its ever growing potential. Here is an issue we have not discussed: The individual’s potential that continues to develop and evolve—this is in your genetic code, this is in your whole being—if you allow the greatest development of your potential to unfold. Then your mortal lifetime becomes a lifetime of its expression —through the exploration of that potential and its development and fulfillment to fruition.\nIf you are a mother or have the close acquaintanceship of a mother, you realize there are many agencies that feed the rosette of influence upon the child-becoming, the individual-becoming. In this country and numerous other countries, there are agencies and associations to assist the child and mother in gaining greater knowledge of child rearing, whether during the time of gestation or afterward. This begins the association of outside influences—the mother is not alone. The father is not alone as a parent with the mother, for he has a wonderful influence upon this child who is coming into existence. Even outside of the mother, the father has a great influence upon this child, for there are hormonal reactions in the mother, and in the child simultaneously, that occur from the closeness of the father.\nThe base for the child’s eventual emotional and social well-being is beginning to be formed, even during these nine months. Do not be reclusive when you carry your child, but be social, going about and being with other women, with those who are mature, those who are caring as well. Do not be afraid to go out into social areas unless it threatens your health or the health of the baby. Your timidity and shyness is transferable to your child, and this affects the child during its lifetime. You as growing, mortal beings, who have just begun your infinite life’s journey, are social beings who will always be in association with others throughout the duration of your infinite existence—never alone. Aloneness is something that is not productive for your well-being. Yes, periods of solitude are productive, but aloneness is a different issue.\nWe know too that many in this society and other societies, whether they are technologically advanced or otherwise, oftentimes have a wonderfully warm and supportive environment for the mother and the emergence of the child from the mother. These first few hours are very influential to the well-being of the whole lifetime of the individual. This is a time for care; this is a time for nurturing; this is a time for warmth and cuddling and holding, for in these early moments, these early hours and days and weeks, form the beginning of the fundamental emotion of trust–the feeling of being safe–or its absence. That will affect the individual throughout the duration of their life.\n..Within the first few hours, days and weeks of life, it is the necessity to support this small package, this small human being, this little bundle of spiritual potential.\nWe have a very tender feeling about these small creatures, babies. Guardians are ever near to care for them, watch for them. There is little intervention directly into their welfare, but the watch-care for overseeing the nurturing of your children is immense by your guardians and the guardians of children. There is a cadre, a corps of angels who do nothing but care for children, small children, babies, and infants. They are an influence upon the mothers and the children around them, and fathers, and strangers and those who visit.\nThe household is a sacred space for raising children. This is why family is so important. Mothers who raise children alone, we encourage them to have opposites of some sort, come to visit—outsiders come to visit. It matters not much whether it is men or women who visit, but those who can care for the child, apart from the mother, so that there is an acceptance of being around known individuals—not strangers, but those who become known. This is how the widening circle of the rosette of individuals becomes wider and wider, as the pendulum of their lives swings in ever widening circles.\n",

        "title": "Feeling Safe and Developing Trust",
        "Body": "Monjoronson: Trust is the foundation for the development of all other positive emotions; and trust is only formed when the individual is feeling safe. We have spoken of this before, and you will hear it many times again, in this lifetime and afterwards: you must feel safe in your universe; you must feel safe in your life; you must feel safe in your home, on the street, in your social relationships and in your family. For if you do not feel safe within your family, within that bond that is necessary for you to fully develop into a spiritual, social being, then the rest of your life will be fraught with difficulties. Feeling safe is essential to developing trust.\nWe have noted that some fathers like to throw their infant child into the air and catch them again. We seriously advise against this, until the child is fully aware that this is play-making, that they are not ready for this type of activity until they fully feel safe, for if you do this too early, you have made them feel unsafe, and what does that do? They are always testing their environment to see if they are safe with bigger people. Their fear uses up a tremendous amount of their psychic, emotional and personal energy in focusing on their environment to see if they are going to be safe. This starts very early. It is measurable to us to see the difference between individuals who have been raised safely, to feel safe at all times, and those who have not. Those who feel unsafe withdraw from their environment to feel safe within themselves.\nI am sharing this because it is directly related to sustainability, which as a social activity can only exist when people feel safe in their environment and trust that they will be sustained. Do you see that the belief of being sustained begins in this very, very, narrow time of the child’s existence? It is very important for you to grasp this connection! We cannot express this enough, or strongly enough.\nLet me go further with this so you see this clearly; I do not want you to miss its importance. To feel safe, when the individual withdraws within themselves, they make their universe smaller. Explorers are those who feel courageous, who feel safe to do so. They begin to explore their universe, their world, and in doing so, they are exploring their own potential. The simple task of stacking three blocks upon each other is a simultaneous exploration in the child and its potential, and its environment. Pushing marbles and pushing a chair, or a wagon is an exploration of their potential, to begin to feel powerful, to begin to have an affect upon their environment.\nIf you are withdrawn into yourself, needing to feel safe, then you cannot explore your potential, you cannot explore your environment. By exploring the external environment, you explore your internal environment and that is where your potential lies. Those who have felt timid oftentimes develop their potentials in close areas—they become artists, musicians, writers, they become toy makers, they work with their hands, they work in close environments. It takes tremendous courage to feel safe to become a frontiers person, to go out into the wilderness by yourself for months on end, and come back safe, based upon your own wits; this is not done by timid people. And so, the belief and knowing that you are sustained is one issue; the exploration of all your potential is another and they are totally united; they are totally \"one\" with each other.\n.. It is not odd that the rosette that individuals make becomes bigger in their life, as they explore more of their potential, and as they become more God-centered. The gravity of God filters through the whole universe; it is ever present; it exists—the gravity of light is centered upon the Creator in Paradise. You swing into that with your decisions to become God-centered; you swing into that when you will to do God’s will; you swing into that when you make decisions and take actions that fulfill God’s will in your life.\nNo wonder so many people are apart from God: For many, God is a fearful individual, for they do not feel safe in their environment. They do not feel safe with their parents, they do not feel safe with fathers, they do not feel safe with males when they have the identification that God is a man. Let us break this old mold and know that God is within you — to know God from within, not from without. The beginning of the exploration of your great potential begins with an immensely intimate familial relationship with God the Creator, that fragment that lies within you. Then you have the assurance that you are loved, you are cared for, and that you have a course of life that is worthy, you will know that you have purpose in your life and you can give it meaning by your decisions to fulfill that purpose.\n",

        "Body": "Monjoronson: So, you send your children to daycare: Who cares for your children there and what is their life like? Is it just idle time to fill hours of these little hands as they play and relate to others, or is there a positive contribution, a continuity of your own family existence when the child is there with you?\nWe know that diligent careful, loving, potential-unfolding, watch-care for your children may be hard to find, but we urge you as parents, we urge you as caregivers for your children, that you must do this, you must diligently search for this, and if you have none, then pray for it to come into existence for you. You are living with a huge potential – these are not just little beings to make you happy – these are God’s children becoming something in their own right, something that you will never know, after you pass. You never know what they will become after you leave.\n..There are eras in the life of each individual when he or she is most receptive to learning influences. There is the time of languages when a child can learn many languages simultaneously, and having done so, if they practice from time-to-time during their childhood, adolescence and adulthood, will become multi-lingual. There is the era of mathematics, social skills, and music, for example. It is time for procreative parents-to-be and grandparents to be aware of these eras. These eras are known to your scientists and educators, and to your child developmental psychologists. We urge you to assist in providing appropriate resources to these children during these eras, so that they are not passed by and forgotten, having this blank spot in their repertoire of skills.\n..Your responsibility as a parent during this era is large and weighty because you are most influential in the child’s life. We urge you to assist your child in exploring various activities of play, social life, the arts, mechanical skills, and languages, and so on. Urge your children to mingle among others, so that their social skills are developed. Urge them to go out and mingle. To be shy is an affliction—it is not a disease, but simply an affliction that can cause an individual great turmoil in adulthood, and withhold them from the pleasures of good social association, of even finding a mate. It takes a great deal of courage to overcome shyness, to become social and enjoy it.\nThis is one of the greatest modeling skills that you can give your own children, your grandchildren, is to have your children tag along with you as you socialize, and to have your friends recognize that your child is an adult-in-the-making, to be appreciated, even in their diminutive size, rather than being dismissed. So many of you were dismissed in childhood as being insignificant and not meaningful, to be seen and not heard, never to have an opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way. In the beginning, it is playfulness and young children will say strange things, but a negative reaction from others makes that exploration an activity of pain and social withdrawal.\nIt takes a great deal of maturity on everyone’s part to associate with infants, children, teenagers, and young adults in a meaningful way. It takes courage to step up to them and be friendly with them—to be more than friendly—to be helpful and to show your affection and appreciation for their existence. At no time do we advise anyone to be condescending to children, nor to be over-bearing, but to be tolerant and directive if necessary — loving and supportive, advising them ahead of time in social situations so that they feel comfortable.\nEach of you will be in the mansion worlds before long, and there will be a team there waiting for you, to introduce you to everyone there, to explain what is happening, how you feel, and why you feel the way you do, and what your thoughts are at the moment, and that you are acquainted with these people. You will know them; they will know you. They will guide you in this early era of your association, when you come together in your full-being, in this being in which you will live until the next era of consciousness when you traverse from the spiritual realm to eternity. This will occur through eons of time, and everywhere along the way there are always helpful people to make you feel at home, to make you feel comfortable, to assist you in feeling that you are one of them.\nEven as a novice, you will always be greeted with respect; there will always be friendly affection for you; you will never be a stranger. Though you will be recognized as a novice by the simple spectra of colors your \"wear,\" you will be appreciated and respected for where you are. The burden of social associations that you had as a mortal will continue, so those natures are something that you will need to extinguish, and surely, we will do everything we can in your afterlife to assist you to explore your potential, and of course this means in association with others.\n",

        "Body": "This era of young adulthood is a magnificent time. It is a most confusing time for everyone—parents, grandparents, for the child themselves, for their associates—for it is an unusual time of awakening, where this pre-pubescent body comes into the pubescent era and then early adulthood. It is a most disconcerting time for everyone. Prepare these prepubescent children ahead of time for this era. There need be no mystery to this era for them or for you. Prepare to be aware ahead of time. Take them out socially in association and assist them to develop their social skills to help them avoid confusing social situations.\nThe presence of absentee parents and latchkey children in a society is most unfortunate, but we know it exists. Even within those constraints, you can make major contributions to the evolvement of these children to become fully social and spiritually emerging individuals.\nThis is an exciting time; this is a time of awakening within them. They have grand thoughts; they have idealistic thoughts; they have thoughts of adventure, of challenging that which exists around them, of challenging authority, of challenging themselves, of challenging you. This is a time to help them develop constructive goals and to understand those that are unproductive and why they are productive—but the choice is the child’s, none-the-less.\nAlways advise them of potential outcomes of their decisions, whatever decisions they make, and they will invite you into assisting them to become participants in their journey. The sustainability of an individual is so ripe in this era, for this is the time of great exploration and wild ideas. It is a time for them to explore how they can sustain themselves in the future, and this is best done by exploring the potential that is ripe within them.\nThe potential within them that helps them become who they will become, both as a social individual and as an aspiring soul, a part of the economy of life, a part of your literal monetary economy. If you withhold a child from exploring their musical talents, then the great, popular, successful musician and artist that they could become is denied them. This is an error of omission, rather than commission. We ask you to commit yourself to helping this child explore their world, and the world of potentials within themselves.\nYou never know the potential that can be expressed in an individual, if it is never explored and challenged. What greatness lies within each of you that has never been explored and developed? Some of you have potentials that are amazing — we are most certainly aware of them. We do not share this with you individually because you would see this as a disappointment, another thing that would help you withdraw. We do not want you to withdraw from life; we want you to explore it. Get out and explore life, challenge yourself.\nAs procreative parents, parents, and grandparents, it is your chore, your duty— one that you have accepted, one that you have said you I will do, simply by the fact that you became a parent—to assist your children and grandchildren to explore their potential. Only then, can you help them become sustainable in their lifetime. What does it take to become a sustainable individual? Some of you scrabble around in life with great difficulty. You have so much potential you have not explored. Many of you feel uncomfortable to do so—that is your decision—we urge you to, though. Explore your potential! Assist your children exploring their potential. Life does not have to be a mean and difficult experience when your potentials have been explored and developed.\n",

        "Body": "We can offer lessons; we can bring you encouragement; we can foster your development, but until you come to a place of accepting your position then all the training and exercises are laying in wait pending your decision. I ask you to consider this week this most pivotal question because very, very soon there will come the need to act as my mission — in fact, our mission — is about to proceed apace, and it will be necessary to have the involvement of all those who are ready.\nI put this call out to you today to consider what will it take for you to be ready to herald this new age with me. What is it your heart desires to enable you to fulfill your spiritual destinies?\nWhat is it that may be lacking that you have not embraced for you to consider yourself worthy? Are you listening to that part of you which yearns to be about the fulfillment of your spiritual destiny? I urge you to consider these issues from a different perspective. Attempt to minimize the impact of your processing center of your thinking construct and ask yourself this question from a deeper center.\nYour physical being may seek to identify all your perceived limitations for you, but there is an aspect of yourself which is unlimited. Whereas you may consider in your minds that you are unable to be so grand, there is a part of you that is so grand. Consider turning over more of yourself to this unlimited and ultimately capable part of yourself. Consider this question of worthiness from the perspective of the desires of your heart.\nAttempt to not allow your mind to diminish your greatness. Attempt to put aside known patterns and parameters in favor of operating in faith and trust in that part of you which knows and can do anything. This is perhaps the most challenging exercise such devoted students as yourselves may face. You have heard repeatedly these universe principles of going within, of trusting, of faith, of being that which you know, following your heart's desire to be great, but these are principles exposed to the mind and not yet embraced by the heart.\nYour minds serve you as one of the greatest of your tools for navigating your way through this process, but they are also limited in their capacity to understand that which they have not experienced before. Therefore sometimes your desires, your faith, and your heart, must lead the way because your mind has not experienced the path before. It is, from which seat you will function, the seat of known parameters and restrictions and definitions or the seat of faith and wonder and trust and that which may even be unknown to you? Perhaps this week you may contemplate the distinction between these centers of operation.\nYou will of course require the use of your mind in this exercise, but attempt to traverse the distance between that which the mind would have you know and that which you only attain by faith. In order to operate in the realm of faith it will be necessary for you to override the signals of the mind when you reach the limitation of experience. The only way to travel beyond that which you do not know is to reach out in faith so that you can know. You are quite accustomed to the mind leading and the soul following. I ask you to attempt the reversal of these roles and allow your soul to reach beyond that which your mind currently understands. This is what will be required when we move into an era which is previously uncharted.\nYour minds will not have the experience in their database to provide you with adequate comfort zone, but there is a larger part of you which does know, which will extend in faith and reach out beyond these zones of comfort to encompass that which is currently outside but that may become contained within your zones of comfort as soon as you are exposed to them. There is nothing for you to fear in this process of reaching and discovering that which is outside your arena of understanding, rather it is a thrilling opportunity to expand yourselves beyond what you know yourselves to be.\nIn this new phase of undertaking we will be confronted with the boundaries of our comfort zones as defined by our temporal understanding. Seek to distinguish when to operate from which of your centers, that which you have familiarity with and is known to your processor, or that which might be outside of your known database and requires the use of your faith to achieve. This is our current challenge, and I invite you to consider from both of your centers of operation this question because it will be required of you to operate from both of your centers relative to that which is demanding of you as we proceed.\nThank you for sharing energy signatures with me that we may become more familiar and be able to operate as needed as we foresee the demands upon us just before us. Your minds may harbor uncertainties, even doubts, about what is ahead, but there is an aspect of yourself which is eager to be about this great expansion and development of the greater part of self. I withdraw now to allow for others. Thank you.\n",

        "title": "You Are Already a Conduit for Truth Through Discernment",
        "Body": "You have a number of manuals and texts that you may use in your attempts to make this identification and realization but just as with anything learned through the conventional mind process, to become firmly seated as an aspect of your being it must be experienced and used in your lives.\nSo while we may, this evening or any evening, gain much in the discussion and portrayal of this aspect of your being, it is not until you each one determine to take your work out into the field and test these theories that they will become your actual experiences from which you may draw your most profound awareness's. Your texts attempt to describe the composition of your being by delineating your component parts and this may be useful to the mind in its attempt to organize this information and process to the limit of its ability the relationship described, but all of you have in fact had direct personal experience with your divine component and have been engaged in your lab experiments for most of your lives while not understanding what it is that you were observing in the process.\nIn fact all of you can recall times in your lives where you have seemed to be in the flow with spirit. Perhaps you have provided counsel to a friend and you have provided words that were nourishing to the soul that seemed to just flow from you. Perhaps you were inspired to provide a variation on an idea, perhaps you were even inspired to promote an ideal. You may have had an insight as was described earlier as to how to resolve a difficulty. You all have had epiphanies of understanding. You all have experienced moments of increased awareness. These all were times when you were acting in partnership with your divine fragment and while you may not have attributed the event to this partnership, makes it none the less just as real.\nThat brings the question to mind, are things real if you are unaware of them? If you are inspired and have words of wisdom to speak and you are unaware that they have come from your higher side, does your unawareness make those words any less real? This question is important to consider when we are wading into an arena where each one of you will be required to make your own assessment of the truth contained within any statement. As more and more of you begin to accept your relationship to your inner voice and begin to express yourself in partnership, there will arise this question of authorship. Who said that, was that you, was that more than you, was that divinely inspired, did that have any aspect of yourself contained?\nWas it real, is it true? Therein lies our next great lab project, to go out into the world and to look at everything with a new eye of discernment for spiritual truth. Your culture has an obsession with wanting to know who the author is and therefore how much credibility to devote to any given work. But we are entering a time when divine truth will be flowing from every seam and crack and individual that is willing to let it flow. Therefore we must adjust our perception to accommodate that there will be truths coming from even such as yourselves that is no less true or no less real than if it had come from a impeccable source.\nThis question arises in this process of transmitting and receiving and projecting out that which people are getting from the outside or perhaps even from the inside. There will be misidentification of authorship. Was it Monjoronson, could it have been Michael? Perhaps Machiventa?, perhaps it was a combined sentiment from \"the other side\". Does that matter in reference to the value contained, to the truths represented? If it is applicable and truthful and righteous, then take it, accept it as the gift that it is from on high. If you are uncertain of the authorship, does that change the validity?\nIf a man on the street offers you a smile and words of wisdom do you discount that because he is not at a pulpit? No. We are growing beyond those limitations. You need not be at a pulpit, in front of a group of individuals that have conferred authority upon you. You need not be anything more than sincere and willing for you each one to be a conduit of truth. You may stumble because you are not certain of the origin of this truth. You may be unwilling to move forward because you have not had a bold proclamation as to who would have you deliver such truths, But my friends, truth is truth and whether it is delivered by the most highs or a stranger passing by, if it is in your presence, likely it is meant for you.\nIf you begin to look at life as potential truth everywhere you will open up vast opportunities for growth and understanding. If you wait to get your truth until the next time we meet, for instance, then how many days will pass where you are not looking for truth, not receptive to the truth in your own laboratory experience. I encourage you to be prepared to find the truth anywhere and everywhere. The Father will use all means available to reach you, to comfort you, to provide you with that which you are seeking. It need not be in any strict form that you should wait to receive it in, rather the true master knows that the truth abounds everywhere and is readily available to any who has eyes to see and ears to hear.\nI encourage you to practice this discernment of truth, not take every statement made as righteous and divine by any means but run each statement and every action through your filter of discernment to glean from those instances what truth may be contained. Your culture has told you to be wary of all things, to trust nothing until it has been proven to you, until it has been given authority. But I tell you that is not how The Father operates. Each of you are receivers and each of you are transmitters of truth as well to the degree that you will allow this to occur. So as you go out and about in the fields of your lives, develop your sense of awareness that truth may be at every turn, at any turn and whether or not you can identify to your satisfaction the source of this truth, the authorship of this truth, make every attempt to not overlook it.\nYou have an accurate filter within. If it is of divinity then it will resonate and ring your truth bell internally. If it is questionable or marginal then you will not have such a profound response and you are also all familiar with the response provided when you encounter things that do not at all resemble righteousness or divinity. You are well aware of the many times you have encountered things which do not sit well with you, that you do not accept and you need now to trust yourself in this process. I say trust yourself but you are not alone in this either, even in your process there is one with you who will confirm for you the validity of the truth contained or will decline to affirm for you that this is material that is appropriate for you.\nYou all have an instinct that needs to be fostered as to what is true and right and good and what does not have those elements, but you cannot practice this and do this accurately if you do not accept that there are many avenues to be examined, that there may be found in any number of sources [things] that do not appear to have divine authorship. Still there may be truths and if you even glean one small aspect of truth contained within a body of work then you have exercised your discernment and you have grown wiser in the process. Be gentle with yourselves as you begin to feel the promptings more clearly in your lives, be gentle with yourselves that these are real.\nThey can only be real if you will accept them and the moment that you accept that they are real they become your possessions and these truths build the one upon the other and become your wisdom. You have demonstrated your ability to expand your perception box that has brought you here in this hour; now as you go out into the field, practice demonstrating expanding your perception box to include that truth may flow from another unsuspected and as well from yourself. Do not overlook that this is a valid avenue available to you by your habitual pattern to first reject until you have been convinced and approve of the channel.\nRather observe the channel before you reject, expand your perception box to at least try to perceive what the truth content may be in anything that comes your way and fear not that you will be grossly mislead because those of you who are devoted to the truth are developing your abilities to discern exactly that. There is nothing to be feared, there is nothing to be lost in the process of looking for truth anywhere and everywhere because only that which you allow in becomes real to you. The rest of it is subject to your approval and cannot adversely impact you for having contacted it. You are quite secure in your inner self where you and your voice dwell. The outside world only becomes real when you choose it as reality, therefore you have nothing to fear of being overtaken or dominated or corrupted unless that is what you choose.\n",

        "Body": "Q: I have been working with a friend who is a healer and he has lost his faith in himself because he has had many psychic attacks. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can inspire him so he can start healing again and helping people?\nMonjoronson: I would remind him of what I said just a moment ago that he is completely safe within. There are no forces in this universe that can assault an individual unless they have opened the door to this assault. That is, if he feels assaulted, if he feels alone, if he feels a victim at any time, to partner himself with whatever divine personality he is familiar with: to ask for assistance, to ask for this friend to come and be with him and assure him that he is in fact safe. That he has ultimate control over this situation and he may need to adopt different techniques wherein he creates a safe environment for him to practice his skill.\nThis attitude of creation and manifestation is one that we all must navigate in this process. To create another reality is quite a simple task of choosing to do just that. Empower him with the knowledge that he is not alone or is not a victim to be assaulted, he is a powerful co-creative being who can manifest any reality he chooses. That is true with all of you here tonight. You are all powerful co-creative beings that know not of your power. If you only understood what you are capable of your lives would manifest quite differently but your life has patterned you to accept your position, your condition in this life. Are you sick, are you well, are you rich, are you poor?\nSociety, your culture labels you in these ways, you have been injured and therefore lo and behold, you are. In this process of discovery you will find that you can manifest any number or realities by simply activating your choice, by directing your intention, by manifesting your purpose. You need not be what you were labeled, poor, sick, a victim, attacked. Those are all material restrictions and limitations imposed upon you in the material dimension. Your soul is none of those things. The greater part of you has nothing to do with any aspect of materialism that is restrictive whatsoever.\nIf you were to look at life from the part of you that is eternal, the big part of you, the forever part of you, the divine part of you, then you will begin to see that all these temporal things are just that, temporal manifestations of conditions in your lives. They do not define you, most of them don't even exist. But many will live their entire lives believing that they exist, accepting that they exist and therefore, once again, they are real. That is a good point to make. It may not even be true, but it may very well be real to the individual who accept it and embraces it.\nThe truth is that you are a divine creative being but you may in fact accept another version of who you are and for a while, that version that you have in your mind will be real and you will manifest that thought about yourself. Your thought and your words and your deeds are what define you as a creative being; therefore in this exercise even today we must be conscious of our thoughts, their limitations, their expectations because our thoughts condition the very reality that we navigate and here is the key. Your thoughts are not fixed and neither is your reality.\nChange your thoughts about who you are and you will change your reality about who you are. You will manifest your new creative prerogative, you\nwill reflect what you project. So not only to your friend who has seen himself assaulted, but to all of you, be concerned over the vision you have of yourself. Do not shortchange yourself, do not bring limitations to who you are in your thought process because that is exactly what you will experience. You literally are creating your life whether you know it or not. So now that you know it, what will you create? What will you choose?\nI encourage you to choose your loftiest ideal, your highest notion, your grandest vision of who you are. Settle for nothing less, be determined. Project those thoughts and you will find that your world will change and conform to support your notion of who you are. You are not out there buffeted about by life's circumstances, reacting to the ways of time and space. No, my friends, you are divine beings who are creating the circumstances and the storms that may arise around you. You may also create the calm. You choose, you decide and then you be. I hope this inspires you to seize control over your creative capacity and the origin of that which is your thoughts and to use these as your greatest tools for becoming that which you are destined to be, divine creatures, creators and children of the First Source and Center.\n",

        "Body": "Jonathan: It does and I would like to add an image. Your guidance and from all the teachers have helped me hit the bull's eye. Now I can hit that bull's eye again. I hope to unleash a second arrow and split that first arrow in half. So I request your further guidance.\nMonjoronson: And I assure you and all of you that no teacher, no parents, no instructor, no guide would turn away anyone with a sincere desire to ask and to receive. It is simply not part of the relationship to withhold anything from one of sincere intent. So rest in peace that there will never come a time when you would ask and you would not receive.\nWho you may receive from may shift; how you may receive may change; what you will receive certainly will be altered, but it is forever and always true, my dear ones, ask and you shall receive. Never entertain doubts that you will be cut off by a universe who loves you. It is simply not in the plans. You are always and forever lovingly tended to, and this includes the answer to your question, the furnishing of what you need even if it is your questioning heart and mind. You are never left without. You are beginning to sense this even in this life. It remains true and constant throughout, and I understand that there are personal relationships that become very important to you as individuals, and you would like to assume that these would maintain, and I would tell you that the relationships that you have developed with your celestial friends are enduring in quality and nature even more so than the relationship that you develop with your mortal counterpart.\nThese ones that you have developed in spirit are instantly available to you and accessible to you quite more easily than your mortal relationships that require your physical presence to facilitate. Rest assured the friendships that we share and enjoy and cherish in these moments are enduring, and we will have the opportunities to cherish such relationships throughout our experiences.\nJonathan: Thank you.\nMonjoronson: I would accept your gratitude and I would offer you mine after all, my dear ones, how many of you are there who would offer to become friends with me? Who would offer to welcome me? I cherish those at this time who are willing to extend beyond what can be seen into the real development of lasting friendships, and this we have done. We have bridged the gap, my dear ones. It is a miracle that we know each other, that we have come together in this way, in this time. It is a demonstration of what is possible when we choose and when we direct our intention and will. We have bridged the gap. Together we have forged this alliance; we have formed these relationships, and we now both may savor the sweetness of such an accomplishment. I assure you I do; I take this cup; I welcome it; I drink it with you. I toast you my friends, my associates, my partners, and soon my associate ambassadors. You have Michael's peace. I bring you my love and affection. I desire your friendship and, as with any good friend, it is up to us to maintain this relationship.\nI offer you my commitment, and I receive yours that we may have these enduring relationships, even friendships, throughout time and even within space. Be of great joy as I am to consider such a miracle.\n",
